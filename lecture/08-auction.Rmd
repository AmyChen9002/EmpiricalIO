## General symmetric information model

### Setting

- General symmetric information model [@milgromTheoryAuctionsCompetitive1982].
- The seller has a single item.
- There are $N$ potential risk neutral buyers/bidders.
- Each bidder $i$ observes a real-valued private signal $X_i$.
- There is a random variable or vector $V$ that influences the value of the object to the bidders.
- The joint distribution of $(V, X_1, \cdots, X_N)$ is $F$.
- Bidder $i$'s payoff is $U_i = u_i(V, X_i, X_{-i})$ when the bidder $i$ obtains the object being sold.
- The seller announces a reserve price $r$.
- The primitives of the model, the number of bidders $N$, the distribution $F$, and teh utility functions $\{u_i\}_{i = 1}^N$, are common konwledge among buyers.
- Assumption: $u_i$ is non-negative, continuous, increasing in each argument and symmetric in the components of $X_{-i}$.
- Assumption: $(V, X_1, \cdots, X_N)$ are affiliated.
    - The $n$ random variables $X = (X_1, \cdots, X_N)$ with joint density $f(x)$ are affiliated if for all $x$ and $y$, $f(x \wedge y) f(x \vee y) \ge f(x) f(y)$. If affiliated, they are non-negatively correlated.
- $\to$ $U_1, \cdots, U_N$ are affiliated.
