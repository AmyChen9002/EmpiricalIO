Starting from the geographic market definition in the Merger Decision, we formulate and estimate an oligopoly model with differentiated products. Based on the estimates, we compare several alternative market power tests: a hypothetical market power test, an actual market power test and a comparative market power test. Our comparison of these alternative tests illustrates that the recently introduced empirical techniques need not be in conflict with traditional policy practices in Europe, but should be seen as a natural extension of commonly accepted principles. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of our dynamic comparative market power test in the European context. According to this test, the relevant point of comparison when assessing a merger is not the status quo, but rather a relevant alternative merger scenario that is likely to happen in the event the merger is rejected. In a European context, the choice is often to accept a sequence of regionally based mergers or rather a sequence of pan-European mergers. Finally, we also emphasize the importance of constructing confidence intervals when computing the predicted merger effects, especially if one is interested in testing the hypothesis that a merger has no effects.},

I find that standard simulation methods, which measure the effect of the change in ownership on unilateral pricing incentives, do not generally provide an accurate forecast. By incorporating postmerger information into the model, I measure the relative importance of other factors that also contributed to the observed price changes. The results indicate that the unexplained component of the price change is largely accounted for by supply-side effects. I conclude that deviations from the assumed model of firm conduct play an important role in accounting for the differences between the predicted and observed price changes. This conclusion suggests that the predictive performance of merger simulation would benefit if more flexible models of firm conduct were incorporated into the methodology.},

This interpretation is particularly useful when some of the components of choice at the level of the individual are discrete. This paper reviews the theory of WTP measurement, and provides easily computed WTP bounds. It reviews generalized extreme value (GEV) random utility models, where analytic formulas for WTP result when indirect utility is linear in income. It shows that a representative consumer characterization of the random utility model, which yields exact WTP when indirect utility is linear in income, can give substantially biased estimates of WTP when indirect utility is nonlinear in income. Finally, it describes a monte carlo markov chain simulation method that can be used to obtain accurate approximation of mean WTP in GEV random utility models that are nonlinear in income. This procedure is of independent interest as a method for obtaining random draws from a GEV density.},

When one of these new variates is added to an extreme-value (logistic) variate, the resulting distribution is also extreme value (logistic). Thus, quite complicated variance structures can be generated by recur-sively adding components having this new distribution, and the result will retain a marginal extreme-value (logistic) distribution. It is demonstrated that the computational simplicity of extreme-value error structures extends to the introduction of heterogeneity in duration, selection bias, limited-dependent-and qualitative-variable models. The usefulness of these new classes of distributions is illustrated with the examples of nested logit, multivariate risk, and competing risk models, where important generalizations to conventional stochastic structures are developed. The new models are shown to be computationally simpler and far more tractable than alternatives such as estimation by simulated moments. These results will be of considerable use to applied microeconomic researchers who have been hampered by computational difficulties in constructing more sophisticated estimators.},

Second, we provide guidelines to use MME in applied work and illustrate with an application how it can endogenize the market structure in a dynamic industry model even with hundreds of firms. Third, we develop a series of results that provide support for using MME as an approximation. We present numerical experiments showing that MME approximates MPE for important classes of models. Then, we introduce novel unilateral deviation error bounds that can be used to test the accuracy of MME as an approximation in large-scale settings. Overall, our new framework opens the door to study new issues in industry dynamics.},

Eliminating heterogeneity bias causes 97\% of the variance in the price level of food products across cities to disappear relative to a conventional index. Eliminating both biases reverses the common finding that prices tend to be higher in larger cities. Instead, we find that price level for food products falls with city size.},

Like almost all empirical work which relies on a production function to re-cover productivity measures, I do not observe physical output at the firm level. There-fore, it is imperative to control for unobserved prices and demand shocks. I develop an empirical model that combines a demand system with a production function to gener-ate estimates of productivity. I rely on my framework to identify the productivity effects from reduced trade protection in the Belgian textile market. This trade liberalization provides me with observed demand shifters that are used to separate out the associated price, scale, and productivity effects. Using a matched plant\textendash{}product level data set and detailed quota data, I find that correcting for unobserved prices leads to substantially lower productivity gains. More specifically, abolishing all quota protections increases firm-level productivity by only 2 percent as opposed to 8 percent when relying on stan-dard measures of productivity. My results beg for a serious reevaluation of a long list of empirical studies that document productivity responses to major industry shocks and, in particular, to opening up to trade. My findings imply the need to study the impact of changes in the operating environment on productivity together with market power and prices in one integrated framework. The suggested method and identification strategy are quite general and can be applied whenever it is important to distinguish between revenue productivity and physical productivity.},

In spite of the general use of love-of-variety models, there has been no systematic study of how the import of new varieties has contributed to national welfare gains in the United States. In this paper, we show that the unmeasured growth in product variety from U.S. imports has been an important source of gains from trade over the last three decades (1972-2001). Using extremely disaggregated data, we show that the number of imported product varieties has increased by a factor of four. We also estimate the elasticities of substitution for each available category at the same level of aggregation and describe their behavior across time and SITC-5 industries. Using these estimates, we develop an exact price index and find that the upward bias in the conventional import price index is approximately 1.2 percent per year. The magnitude of this bias suggests that the welfare gains from variety growth in imports alone are 2.8 percent of GDP.},

  doi = {10.2139/ssrn.1856558},
  abstract = {User-Generated Content (UGC) on social media platforms and product search engines is changing the way consumers shop for goods online. However, current product search engines fail to effectively leverage information created across diverse social media platforms. Moreover, current ranking algorithms in these product search engines tend to induce consumers to focus on one single product characteristic dimension (e.g., price, star rating). This approach largely ignores consumers' multi-dimensional preferences for products. In this paper, we propose to generate a ranking system that recommends products that provide on average the best value for the consumer's money. The key idea is that products that provide a higher surplus should be ranked higher on the screen in response to consumer queries. We use a unique dataset of U.S. hotel reservations made over a three-month period through Travelocity, which we supplement with data from various social media sources using techniques from text mining, image classification, social geo-tagging, human annotations, and geo-mapping. We propose a random coefficient hybrid structural model, taking into consideration the two sources of consumer heterogeneity the different travel occasions and different hotel characteristics introduce. Based on the estimates from the model, we infer the economic impact of various location and service characteristics of hotels. We then propose a new hotel ranking system based on the average utility gain a consumer receives from staying in a particular hotel. By doing so, we can provide customers with the ``best-value" hotels early on. Our user studies, using ranking comparisons from several thousand users, validates the superiority of our ranking system relative to existing systems on several travel search engines. On a broader note, this paper illustrates how social media can be mined and incorporated into a demand-estimation model in order to generate a new ranking system in product search engines. We thus highlight the tight linkages between user behavior on social media and search engines. Our inter-disciplinary approach provides several insights for using machine learning techniques in economics and marketing research.},

  volume = {68},
  abstract = {Car prices in Europe are characterized by large and persistent differences across countries. The purpose of this paper is to document and explain this price dispersion. Using a panel data set extending from 1980 to 1993, the authors first demonstrate two main facts concerning car prices in Europe: (1) The existence of significant differences in quality adjusted prices across countries; (2) substantial year-to-year volatility that is to a large extent accounted for by exchange rate fluctuation and the incomplete response of local currency prices to these fluctuations. These facts are analyzed within the framework of a multi-product oligopoly model with product differentiation. The model identifies three potential sources for the international price differences: price elasticities generating differences in markups, costs, and import quota constraints. The authors find that the primary reason for the higher prices in Italy is the existence of a strong bias for domestic brands that generates high markups for the domestic firm. In the UK higher prices are mainly attributed to better equipped cars and/or differences in the dealer car practices. The import quota constraints are found to have a significant impact on Japanese car prices},

One particular problem with these applications is that they have ignored possible correlations between the independent variables in the determin-istic component of utility (price, promotion, etc.) and the stochastic component or error term. In fact, marketing-mix variables, such as price, not only affect brand purchasing probabilities but are themselves endogenously set by marketing managers. This work tests whether these endogeneity problems are important enough to warrant consideration when estimating random utility models with scanner panel data. Our results show that not accounting for endogeneity may result in a substantial bias in the parameter estimates.},

It leads to inconsistency with standard estimation methods that maintain independence between the model's error and the included vari ables. The authors describe a control function approach for handling endogeneity in choice models. Observed variables and economic theory are used to derive controls for the dependence between the endogenous variable and the demand error. The theory points to the relationships that contain information on the unobserved demand factor, such as the pric ing equation and the advertising equation. The authors' approach is an alternative to Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes's (1995) product-market con trols for unobserved quality. The authors apply both methods to examine households' choices among television options, including basic and pre mium cable packages, in which unobserved attributes, such as quality of programming, are expected to be correlated with price. Without correcting for endogeneity, aggregate demand is estimated to be upward-sloping, suggesting that omitted attributes are positively correlated with demand. Both the control function method and the product-market controls method produce downward-sloping demand estimates that are similar.},

The existing literature typically incorporates the impact of product reviews on sales based on numeric variables representing the valence and volume of reviews. In this paper, we posit that the information embedded in product reviews cannot be captured by a single scalar value. Rather, we argue that product reviews are multifaceted, and hence the textual content of product reviews is an important determinant of consumers' choices, over and above the valence and volume of reviews. To demonstrate this, we use text mining to incorporate review text in a consumer choice model by decomposing textual reviews into segments describing different product features. We estimate our model based on a unique data set from Amazon contain-ing sales data and consumer review data for two different groups of products (digital cameras and camcorders) over a 15-month period. We alleviate the problems of data sparsity and of omitted variables by providing two experimental techniques: clustering rare textual opinions based on pointwise mutual information and using externally imposed review semantics. This paper demonstrates how textual data can be used to learn consumers' relative preferences for different product features and also how text can be used for predictive modeling of future changes in sales.},

This paper examines whether and when state technical capabilities attract foreign investment in manufacturing from 1987-1993. We find that on average state R\&D intensity does not attract foreign direct investment. Most investing firms are in lower-tech industries and locate in low R\&D intensity states, suggesting little interest in state technical capabilities. In contrast , we find that firms in research-intensive industries are more likely to locate in states with high R\&D intensity. Foreign firms in the pharmaceutical industry value state R\&D intensity the most, at a level twice that of firms in the semiconductor industry, and four times that of electronics firms. Interestingly, not only firms from technically lagging nations, but also some firms from technically leading nations are attracted to R\&D intensive states. This suggests that beyond catching up, firms use knowledge-seeking investments also to source technical diversity.},

  title = {Estimating {{Equilibrium Models}} of {{Local Jurisdictions}}},
  abstract = {Research over the past several years has led to the development of models characterizing equilibrium in a system of local jurisdictions. An important insight from these models is that plausible single-crossing assumptions about preferences generate strong predictions about the equilibrium distribution of households across communities. To date, these predictions have not been subjected to formal empirical tests. The purpose of this paper is to provide an integrated approach for testing predictions from this class of models. We first test conditions for locational equilibrium implied by these models. In particular, we test predictions about the distribution of households by income across communities. We then test the models' predictions about the relationships among locational equilibrium conditions, housing markets, and housing prices. By drawing inferences from a structural general equilibrium model, the paper offers a unified treatment of theory and empirical testing.

First, households are willing to pay less than 1 percent more in house prices-substantially lower than previous estimates-when the average performance of the local school increases by 5 percent. Second, much of the apparent willingness to pay for more educated and wealthier neighbors is explained by the correlation of these sociodemographic measures with unobserved neighborhood quality. Third, neighborhood race is not capitalized directly into housing prices; instead, the negative correlation of neighborhood percent black and housing prices is due entirely to the fact that blacks live in unobservably lower-quality neighborhoods. Finally, there is considerable heterogeneity in preferences for schools and neighbors, with households preferring to self-segregate on the basis of both race and education.},

  abstract = {Differentiated products are the central economic focus of competition in consumer goods products such as cereal, soda, and beer. We first estimate demand models which do not restrict unduly the pattern of consumer preferences as does much previous research in the area of differenciated products. Using recently available transactions data we estimate own and cross price elasticities in a relatively unrestricted manner. We next turn to competitive analysis using our estimated demand system. We consider two applications in this paper. The main economic factor that we consider is that the firms which produce the differentiated products almost always tend to be multi-product firms in the given industry. Our first application is competitive analysis when two firms are allowed to merge. The other application that we consider is inference on the competitive structure in an industry. In both applications we consider the effect of a multi-product firm where its competitive decisions for one brand affects it sales and prices for other brands that it produces. /// La diff\'erenciation des produits est un aspect \'economique central de la concurrence sur les march\'es des biens de consommations comme les c\'er\'eales, les sodas ou les bi\`eres.

Where these conditions hold, we show how information may be recovered on individual consumers' marginal valuations of product attributes. In some cases, marginal valuations are point identified, and in other cases, we can only recover bounds. Where the conditions fail, we highlight the role which the introduction of unobserved product attributes can play in rationalizing the data.

We allow the number of heterogeneous groups and the number of controls to exceed the sample size. To make informative inference possible, we assume that the treatment effect has a sparse representation and estimate it in two stages. In the first stage, we estimate the reduced form for treatment and outcome on an auxiliary sample. In the second stage, we estimate the treatment effect by 1-regularized least squares regression of outcome residuals on the treatment residuals. The proposed estimator presents an improved convergence rate over a one-stage alternative where the treatment effect and the control function are estimated jointly. In addition, we provide inference methods for single and multiple coefficients of the heterogeneous effects. We use a correlated random effects approach to model unobserved unit heterogeneity by extending the approaches from Mundlak (1978) and Cham-berlain (1982) to a high-dimensional setting. Using the data from a major food distributor, we apply our method to estimate price elasticities for a large number of heterogeneous products and validate our estimates using experimental price variation.},

In the first stage, I estimate the state variable's law of motion and the equilibrium policy function using machine learning tools. In the second stage, I plug the first-stage estimates into a moment inequality and solve for the structural parameter. The moment function is presented as the sum of two components, where the first one expresses the equilibrium assumption and the second one is a bias correction term that makes the sum insensitive (i.e., Neyman-orthogonal) to first-stage bias. The proposed estimator uniformly converges at the root-N rate and I use it to construct confidence regions. The results developed here can be used to incorporate high-dimensional state space into classic dynamic discrete choice models, for example, those considered in Rust (1987), Bajari et al.

The chapter shows, first, how economic restrictions can guarantee the identification of nonparametric functions in several structural models. It then describes how shape restrictions can be used to estimate nonparametric functions using popular methods for nonparametric estimation. Finally, the chapter describes how to test nonparametrically the hypothesis that an economic model is correct and the hypothesis that a nonparametric function satisfies some specified shape properties.},

If there is no such statistic, then one may choose an estimate that, in some well-defined sense, makes the known properties of the population hold as closely as possible in the sample.

Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE) in this context requires strategies to depend only on the action to which one's opponent is currently committed. The dynamic programming equations for an MPE are derived. The first application of the model is to a natural monopoly, in which fixed costs are so large that at most one firm can make a profit. The firms install short-run capacity. In the unique symmetric MPE, only one firm is active and practices the quantity analogue of limit pricing. For commitments of brief duration, the market is almost contestable. We conclude with a discussion of more general models in which the alternating timing is derived rather than imposed. Our companion paper applies the model to price competition and provides equilibrium foundations for kinked demand curves and Edgeworth cycles.},

This chapter presents some of the recent results on the identification of nonparametric econometric models. It considers identification in models that are additive in unobservable random terms and in models that are nonadditive in unobservable random terms. Single equation models as well as models with a system of equations are studied. Among the latter, special attention is given to structural models whose reduced forms are triangular in the unobservable random terms, and to simultaneous equations, where the reduced forms are functions of all the unobservable variables in the system. The chapter first presents some general identification results for single-equation models that are additive in unobservable random terms, single-equation models that are nonadditive in unobservable random terms, single-equation models that possess and index structure, simultaneous equations nonadditive in unobservable random terms, and discrete choice models. Then, particular ways of achieving identification are considered. These include making use of conditional independence restrictions, marginal independence restrictions, shape restrictions on functions, shape restrictions on distributions, and restrictions in both functions and distributions. The objective is to provide insight into some of the recent techniques that have been developed recently, rather than on presenting a complete survey of the literature.},

To empirically assess these three forces, I estimate a dynamic oligopoly model using a unique panel data set of hard disk drive manufacturers. The results suggest that despite strong preemptive motives and a substantial cost advantage over entrants, cannibalization makes incumbents reluctant to innovate, which can explain at least 57 percent of the incumbent-entrant innovation gap.},

Consistent with spillovers, we estimate a robust and significantly positive correlation between a domestic plant's TFP and the foreign-affiliate share of activity in that plant's industry. Typical estimates suggest that a 10-percentage-point increase in foreign presence in a U.K. industry raises the TFP of that industry's domestic plants by about 0.5\%. We also use these estimates to calculate the per-job value of these spillovers at about 2,400 in 2000 prices (\$4,300). These calculated values appear to be less than per-job incentives governments have granted in recent high-profile cases, in some cases several times less.},

This paper seeks empirical estimates of the extent of departure from marginal-cost pricing and of the effects of foreign competition. The model estimated has product differentiation, multiproduct firms, and heterogeneity in consumer tastes. The estimation presumes that product type (proxied by engineering specifications) is exogenous to the price/quantity market equilibrium. Cross-section results for the 1977 and 1978 model years yield price-cost margins around 10\%. Import competition has the effect of lowering equilibrium margins for compact and subcompact models.},

The new empirical industrial organization (NEIO) is clearly somewhat different than the previously dominant empirical method in the field, the structure\textendash{}conduct\textendash{}performance paradigm (SCPP). The chapter presents the formation and enforcement of tacitly collusive arrangements, the nature of noncooperative oligopoly interaction in the world, the degree of single-firm market power under product differentiation, and the size and determinants of the industry price-cost margin. It reviews the various empirical models of monopoly power and of oligopoly interaction and describes the theoretical and empirical arguments for why it is monopoly power that is being measured.},

  abstract = {This chapter presents an exposition of econometric methods for modeling producer behavior. The objective of econometric modeling is to determine the nature of substitution among inputs, the character of differences in technology, and the role of economies of scale. The principal contribution of recent advances in methodology has been to exploit the potential of economic theory in achieving this objective. Important innovations in specifying econometric models have arisen from the dual formulation of the theory of production. The chief advantage of this formulation is in generating demands and supplies as the explicit functions of relative prices. By using duality in production theory, these functions can be specified without imposing arbitrary restrictions on the patterns of production. The econometric modeling of producer behavior requires parametric forms for demand and supply functions. The patterns of production can be represented in terms of unknown parameters that specify the responses of demands and supplies to changes in prices, technology, and scale. New measures of substitution, technical change, and economies of scale have provided greater flexibility in the empirical determination of production patterns.},

  abstract = {Often researchers find parametric models restrictive and sensitive to deviations from the parametric specifications; semi-nonparametric models are more flexible and robust, but lead to other complications such as introducing infinite-dimensional parameter spaces that may not be compact and the optimization problem may no longer be well-posed. The method of sieves provides one way to tackle such difficulties by optimizing an empirical criterion over a sequence of approximating parameter spaces (i.e., sieves); the sieves are less complex but are dense in the original space and the resulting optimization problem becomes well-posed. With different choices of criteria and sieves, the method of sieves is very flexible in estimating complicated semi-nonparametric models with (or without) endogeneity and latent heterogeneity. It can easily incorporate prior information and constraints, often derived from economic theory, such as monotonicity, convexity, additivity, multiplicity, exclusion and nonnegativity. It can simultaneously estimate the parametric and nonparametric parts in semi-nonparametric models, typically with optimal convergence rates for both parts. This chapter describes estimation of semi-nonparametric econometric models via the method of sieves. We present some general results on the large sample properties of the sieve estimates, including consistency of the sieve extremum estimates, convergence rates of the sieve M-estimates, pointwise normality of series estimates of regression functions, root-n asymptotic normality and efficiency of sieve estimates of smooth functionals of infinite-dimensional parameters. Examples are used to illustrate the general results.},

It considers techniques for estimating densities, conditional mean functions, derivatives of functions and conditional quantiles in a flexible way that imposes minimal functional form assumptions. The chapter begins by illustrating how flexible modeling methods have been applied in empirical research, drawing on recent examples of applications from labor economics, consumer demand estimation and treatment effects models. Then, key concepts in semiparametric and nonparametric modeling are introduced that do not have counterparts in parametric modeling, such as the so-called curse of dimensionality, the notion of models with an infinite number of parameters, the criteria used to define optimal convergence rates, and ``dimension-free'' estimators. After defining these new concepts, a large literature on nonparametric estimation is reviewed and a unifying framework presented for thinking about how different approaches relate to one another. Local polynomial estimators are discussed in detail and their distribution theory is developed. The chapter then shows how nonparametric estimators form the building blocks for many semiparametric estimators, such as estimators for average derivatives, index models, partially linear models, and additively separable models. Semiparametric methods offer a middle ground between fully nonparametric and parametric approaches. Their main advantage is that they typically achieve faster rates of convergence than fully nonparametric approaches. In many cases, they converge at the parametric rate. The second part of the chapter considers in detail two issues that are central with regard to implementing flexible modeling methods: how to select the values of smoothing parameters in an optimal way and how to implement ``trimming'' procedures. It also reviews newly developed techniques for deriving the distribution theory of semiparametric estimators. The chapter concludes with an overview of approximation methods that speed up the computation of nonparametric estimates and make flexible estimation feasible even in very large size samples.},

We also extend the definition of oblivious equilibrium, originally proposed for models with only firm-specific idiosyncratic random shocks, and our algorithms to accommodate models with industry-wide aggregate shocks.

Such unobserved heterogeneity confounds attempts to uncover the underlying structure of demand and information, typically a primary feature of interest in an auction market. Unobserved heterogeneity presents a particular challenge in first-price auctions, where identification arguments rely on the econometrician's ability to reconstruct from observables the conditional probabilities that entered each bidder's equilibrium optimization problem. When bidders condition on unobservables, it is not obvious that this is possible. Here we discuss several approaches to identification developed in recent work on first-price auctions with unobserved heterogeneity. Despite the special challenges of this setting, all of the approaches build on insights developed in other areas of econometrics, including those on control functions, measurement error, and mixture models. Because each strategy relies on different combinations of model restrictions, technical assumptions, and data requirements, their relative attractiveness will vary with the application. However, this varied menu of results suggests both a type of robustness of identifiability and the potential for expanding the frontier with additional work.},

We review some recent work studying identification in a broad class of such models.

Rather, identification relies primarily on the standard requirement that instruments be available for the endogenous variables-here, typically, prices and quantities.

We also review new results on discrimination between alternative models of oligopoly competition. Together, these results reveal a strong nonparametric foundation for a broad applied literature, provide practical guidance for applied work, and may suggest new approaches to estimation and testing.},

We derive numerical theory results characterizing the properties of the nested fixed point algorithm used to evaluate the objective function of BLP's estimator. We discuss problems with typical implementations, including cases that can lead to incorrect parameter estimates. As a solution, we recast estimation as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints, which can be faster and which avoids the numerical issues associated with nested inner loops. The advantages are even more pronounced for forward-looking demand models where the Bellman equation must also be solved repeatedly. Several Monte Carlo and real-data experiments support our numerical concerns about the nested fixed point approach and the advantages of constrained optimization. For static BLP, the constrained optimization approach can be as much as ten to forty times faster for large-dimensional problems with many markets.},

Most of these estimated models have been parametric. In this paper, we review and extend a number of results on the identification of models that are used in the empirical literature. We study simple versions of both static and dynamic entry models. For simple static models, we show how natural shape restrictions can be used to identify competition effects. We consider extensions to models with heterogeneous firms, mixed-strategy equilibria and private information and provide insights that can be used in these settings to conduct inference. In the case of dynamic models, we review existing results on the model with i.i.d. linear errors, and then consider more realistic cases, such as when the distribution of fixed costs is unknown. 1},

Using data on geographically isolated monopolies, duopolies, and oligopolies, we study the relationship between the number of firms in a market, market size, and competition. Our empirical results suggest that competitive conduct changes quickly as the number of incumbents increases. In markets with five or fewer incumbents, almost all variation in competitive conduct occurs with the entry of the second or third firm. Surprisingly, once the market has between three and five firms, the next entrant has little effect on competitive conduct.},

With respect to the empirical literature on entry games originated by Bresnahan and Reiss (1990) and Berry (1992), the main novelty of our framework is to allow for general forms of heterogeneity across players without making equilibrium selection assumptions. We allow the effects that the entry of each individual airline has on the profits of its competitors, its ``competitive effects,'' to differ across airlines. The identified features of the model are sets of parameters (partial identification) such that the choice probabilities predicted by the econometric model are consistent with the empirical choice probabilities estimated from the data. We apply this methodology to investigate the empirical importance of firm heterogeneity as a determinant of market structure in the U.S. airline industry. We find evidence of heterogeneity across airlines in their profit functions. The competitive effects of large airlines (American, Delta, United) are different from those of low cost carriers and Southwest. Also, the competitive effect of an airline is increasing in its airport presence, which is an important measure of observable heterogeneity in the airline industry. Then we develop a policy experiment to estimate the effect of repealing the Wright Amendment on competition in markets out of the Dallas airports. We find that repealing the Wright Amendment would increase the number of markets served out of Dallas Love.},

This paper both extends and departs from the past literature, which focused on technological explanations for these differences, by proposing that demand-side features also play a role in creating the observed productivity variation. The specific mechanism investigated here is the effect of spatial substitutability in the product market. When producers are densely clustered in a market, it is easier for consumers to switch between suppliers (making the market in a certain sense more competitive). Relatively inefficient producers find it more difficult to operate profitably as a result. Increases in substitutability truncate the productivity distribution from below, resulting in higher minimum and average productivity levels as well as less productivity dispersion. The paper presents a model that makes this process explicit and empirically tests it using data from U.S. ready-mixed concrete plants, taking advantage of geographic variation in substitutability created by the industry's high transport costs. The results support the model's predictions and appear robust. Markets with high demand density for ready-mixed concrete\textemdash{}and thus high concrete plant densities\textemdash{}have higher lower-bound and average productivity levels and exhibit less productivity dispersion among their producers.},

The model is dynamic with rich geographic detail on the locations of stores and distribution centers. Given the enormous number of possible combinations of store-opening sequences, it is difficult to directly solve Wal-Mart's problem, making conventional approaches infeasible.

  abstract = {In the past few decades multistore retailers, especially those with 100 or more stores, have experienced substantial growth. At the same time, there is widely reported public outcry over the impact of these chain stores on other retailers and local communities. This paper develops an empirical model to assess the impact of chain stores on other discount retailers and to quantify the size of the scale economies within a chain. The model has two key features. First, it allows for flexible competition patterns among all players. Second, for chains, it incorporates the scale economies that arise from operating multiple stores in nearby regions. In doing so, the model relaxes the commonly used assumption that entry in different markets is independent. The lattice theory is exploited to solve this complicated entry game among chains and other discount retailers in a large number of markets. It is found that the negative impact of Kmart's presence on Wal-Mart's profit was much stronger in 1988 than in 1997, while the opposite is true for the effect of Wal-Mart's presence on Kmart's profit. Having a chain store in a market makes roughly 50\% of the discount stores unprofitable. Wal-Mart's expansion from the late 1980s to the late 1990s explains about 40\textendash{}50\% of the net change in the number of small discount stores and 30\textendash{}40\% for all other discount stores. Scale economies were important for Wal-Mart, but less so for Kmart, and the magnitude did not grow proportionately with the chains' sizes.},

Using recent algorithms to compute all of the Nash equilibria to a game, we propose simulation-based estimators for static, discrete games. We demonstrate that the model is identified under weak functional form assumptions using exclusion restrictions and an identification at infinity approach. Monte Carlo evidence demonstrates that the estimator can perform well in moderately sized samples. As an application, we study entry decisions by construction contractors to bid on highway projects in California. We find that an equilibrium is more likely to be observed if it maximizes joint profits, has a higher Nash product, uses mixed strategies, and is not Pareto dominated by another equilibrium.},

We formulate homogeneity tests of (i) the conditional choice and state transition probabilities, (ii) the steady-state distribution, and (iii) the conditional state distribution given an initial state. The null hypotheses of these homogeneity tests are necessary conditions (or maintained assumptions) for poolability of the data. Thus rejections of these null imply that the data cannot be pooled across markets. Acceptances of these null are considered as supporting evidences for the maintained assumptions of estimation using pooled data. In a Monte Carlo study we find that the test based on the steady-state distribution performs well and has high power even with small numbers of markets and time periods. We apply the tests to the empirical study of Ryan (2012) that analyzes dynamics of the U.S. Portland cement industry and assess if the data across markets can be pooled.},

There are multiple MPE's, consisting of both kinked demand curve equilibria and Edgeworth cycles. In any MPE, profit is bounded away from the Bertrand equilibrium level. We show that a kinked demand curve at the monopoly price is the unique symmetric "renegotiation proof" equilibrium when there is little discounting. We then endogenize the timing by allowing firms to move at any time subject to we short-run commitments. We find that firms end up alternating, thus vindicating the ad hoc timing assumption of our simpler model.

This paper studies nonparametric identifiability of type probabilities and type-specific component distributions in finite mixture models of dynamic discrete choices. We derive sufficient conditions for nonparametric identification for various finite mixture models of dynamic discrete choices used in applied work under different assumptions on the Markov property, stationarity, and type-invariance in the transition process. Three elements emerge as the important determinants of identification: the time-dimension of panel data, the number of values the covariates can take, and the heterogeneity of the response of different types to changes in the covariates. For example, in a simple case where the transition function is type-invariant, a time-dimension of T = 3 is sufficient for identification, provided that the number of values the covariates can take is no smaller than the number of types and that the changes in the covariates induce sufficiently heterogeneous variations in the choice probabilities across types. Identification is achieved even when state dependence is present if a model is stationary first-order Markovian and the panel has a moderate time-dimension (T 6).},

Building on earlier work by Berry and Haile (2013), we show that key identifying restrictions are provided by (i) a set of moment conditions generated by instrumental variables together with an inversion of aggregate demand in unobserved product characteristics; and (ii) the variation of the product characteristics across markets that is exogenous to the individual heterogeneity. We further show that two leading models, the BLP-model (Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes, 1995) and the pure characteristics model (Berry and Pakes, 2007), require considerably different conditions on the support of the product characteristics.},

We show that the sequence includes as extreme cases a Hotz-Miller estimator (for K = 1) and Rust's nested fixed point estimator (in the limit when K {$\rightarrow$} {$\infty$}). Furthermore, the asymptotic distribution of all the estimators in the sequence is the same and equal to that of the maximum likelihood estimator.

Two main econometric issues appear in the estimation of these models: the indeterminacy problem associated with the existence of multiple equilibria and the computational burden in the solution of the game. We propose a class of pseudo maximum likelihood (PML) estimators that deals with these problems, and we study the asymptotic and finite sample properties of several estimators in this class. We first focus on two-step PML estimators, which, although they are attractive for their computational simplicity, have some important limitations: they are seriously biased in small samples; they require consistent nonparametric estimators of players' choice probabilities in the first step, which are not always available; and they are asymptotically inefficient. Second, we show that a recursive extension of the two-step PML, which we call nested pseudo likelihood (NPL), addresses those drawbacks at a relatively small additional computational cost. The NPL estimator is particularly useful in applications where consistent nonparametric estimates of choice probabilities either are not available or are very imprecise, e.g., models with permanent unobserved heterogeneity. Finally, we illustrate these methods in Monte Carlo experiments and in an empirical application to a model of firm entry and exit in oligopoly markets using Chilean data from several retail industries.]},

In contrast, the existence of an equilibrium in the Ericson and Pokes' model of industry dynamics requires admissibility of mixed entry/exit strategies, contrary to the assertion in their article, that existing algorithms cannot cope with. In addition, we provide a condition on the model's primitives that ensures that the equilibrium is in pure investment strategies.

Reviewers' design evaluations contain uncertainty from a bidder's perspective, leading luck to dampen differences in the firms' chances of winning. I model bidders' behavior and show semiparametric identification of the model primitives. Uncertain design evaluations increase the expected price of design quality and exacerbate an auctioneer's uncertainty in auction outcomes. These effects are mostly due to changes in bidding strategies. Bid ranking swaps due to uncertain evaluations account for a small share of these effects.},

Such unobserved heterogeneity confounds attempts to uncover the underlying structure of demand and information, typically a primary feature of interest in an auction market. Unobserved heterogeneity presents a particular challenge in first-price auctions, where identification arguments rely on the econometrician's ability to reconstruct from observables the conditional probabilities that entered each bidder's equilibrium optimization problem. When bidders condition on unobservables, it is not obvious that this is possible. Here we discuss several approaches to identification developed in recent work on first-price auctions with unobserved heterogeneity. Despite the special challenges of this setting, all of the approaches build on insights developed in other areas of econometrics, including those on control functions, measurement error, and mixture models. Because each strategy relies on different combinations of model restrictions, technical assumptions, and data requirements, their relative attractiveness will vary with the application. However, this varied menu of results suggests both a type of robustness of identifiability and the potential for expanding the frontier with additional work.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider the conditionally independent private information (CIPI) model which includes the conditionally independent private value (CIPV) model and the pure common value (CV) model as polar cases. Speci"cally, we model each bidder's private information as the product of two unobserved independent components, one speci"c to the auctioned object and common to all bidders, the other speci"c to each bidder. The structural elements of the model include the distributions of the common component and the idiosyncratic component. Noting that the above decomposition is related to a measurement error problem with multiple indicators, we show that both distributions are identi"ed from observed bids in the CIPV case. On the other hand, identi"cation of the pure CV model is achieved under additional restrictions. We then propose a computationally simple two-step nonparametric estimation procedure using kernel estimators in the "rst step and empirical characteristic functions in the second step. The consistency of the two density estimators is established. An application to the OCS wildcat auctions shows that the distribution of the common component is much more concentrated than the distribution of the idiosyncratic component. This suggests that idiosyncratic components are more likely to explain the variability of private information and hence of bids than the common component. 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

Rather than relying on one stylized model to provide                     an exact interpretation of the data, we explore an incomplete model based on two                     simple assumptions: bidders neither bid more than their valuations nor let an                     opponent win at a price they would be willing to beat. Focusing on the symmetric                     independent private values paradigm, we show that this limited structure enables                     construction of informative bounds on the distribution function characterizing                     bidder demand, on the optimal reserve price, and on the effects of observable                     covariates on bidder valuations. If the standard theoretical model happens to be                     the true model, our bounds collapse to the true features of interest. In                     contrast, when the true data-generating process deviates in seemingly                     small ways from that implied by equilibrium in the standard theoretical model,                     existing methods can yield misleading results that need not even lie within our                     bounds. We report results from Monte Carlo experiments illustrating the                     performance of our approach and comparing it to others.

We illustrate the proposed method by studying a market of agricultural products, where descending auctions are used.

Second, we establish the nonparametric identification of the bidders' utility function under exclusion restrictions. Our primary exclusion restriction takes the form of an exogenous bidders' participation, leading to a latent distribution of private values that is independent of the number of bidders. The key idea is to exploit the property that the bid distribution varies with the number of bidders while the private value distribution does not. We then extend these results to endogenous bidders' participation when the exclusion restriction takes the form of instruments that do not affect the bidders' private value distribution. Though derived for a benchmark model, our results extend to more general cases such as a binding reserve price, affiliated private values, and asymmetric bidders.

  abstract = {In dynamic discrete choice analysis, controlling for unobserved heterogeneity is an important issue, and finite mixture models provide flexible ways to account for it. This paper studies nonparametric identifiability of type probabilities and type-specific component distributions in finite mixture models of dynamic discrete choices. We derive sufficient conditions for nonparametric identification for various finite mixture models of dynamic discrete choices used in applied work under different assumptions on the Markov property, stationarity, and type-invariance in the transition process. Three elements emerge as the important determinants of identification: the time-dimension of panel data, the number of values the covariates can take, and the heterogeneity of the response of different types to changes in the covariates. For example, in a simple case where the transition function is type-invariant, a time-dimension of T = 3 is sufficient for identification, provided that the number of values the covariates can take is no smaller than the number of types and that the changes in the covariates induce sufficiently heterogeneous variations in the choice probabilities across types. Identification is achieved even when state dependence is present if a model is stationary first-order Markovian and the panel has a moderate time-dimension (T 6).},

  abstract = {[We adapt the expectation-maximization algorithm to incorporate unobserved heterogeneity into conditional choice probability (CCP) estimators of dynamic discrete choice problems. The unobserved heterogeneity can be time-invariant or follow a Markov chain. By developing a class of problems where the difference in future value terms depends on a few conditional choice probabilities, we extend the class of dynamic optimization problems where CCP estimators provide a computationally cheap alternative to full solution methods. Monte Carlo results confirm that our algorithms perform quite well, both in terms of computational time and in the precision of the parameter estimates.]},
