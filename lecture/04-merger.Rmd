# Merger Analysis {#merger}

## Motivations

- Measuring the market power of firms and predicting the possible consequence of horizontal merger cases is one of the primary goal of empirical industrial organization.
- This is important for antitrust authority to review merger cases.
- To do so, we integrate the product/cost function estimation and demand function estimation techniques.
- We introduce the last piece of parameters that characterize the market competition, __conduct parameter__, and discuss its identification.
- Then, we conduct the first kind of __counterfactual analysis__, the __merger simularion__.
- In this exercise, we predict the market response when the ownership structure of product is changed due to a hypothetical merger.
- Every market institution needs its own model for merger simulation:
- @Gowrisankaran2015:
    - In the U.S. hospitals and managed care organizations (MGO) negotiate the hospital prices and the coinsurance rates.
    - What if hospitals are merged? How much do the hospital prices and the coinsurance rates increase?
- @Smith2004:
    - Sometimes the same service is sold through multiple stores such as in the supermarket industry. 
    - How does this multi-store nature affect the merger effects?
- @Ivaldi2005 reviews the cases in the European Commission.


## Identification of Conduct

### Identification of Conduct

- So far we have been concerned with the two types of parameters:
    - Production and/or cost function.
    - Demand function.
- To identify the marginal cost by the revealed preference approach, we have assumed that firms are engaging in a price competition.
- The mode of competition is another parameter of interest.
- Can we infer the mode of competition instead of assuming it?


### Marginal Revenue Function

- To be specific, consider firms producing homogeneous product.
- Under what conditions can we distinguish across Bertrand competition, Cournot competition, and collusion? [@Bresnahan1982a].
- Consider the following marginal revenue function:
\begin{equation}
MR(Q) \equiv \lambda Q P'(Q) + P(Q),
\end{equation}
where $Q$ is the aggregate quantity, $P(Q)$ is the inverse demand function.
- This formula nests Bertrand, Cournot, and collusion:
- Bertrand: 
    - In Bertrand, a firm cannot change the market price.
    - If a firm increases the production by one unit, whose revenue increases by $P(Q)$.
    - Therefore, $\lambda = 0$.
- Cournot: 
    - In Cournot, the marginal revenue of firm $f$ is:
    $$
    q_f P'(Q) + P(Q).
    $$
    - Therefore, $\lambda = s_f$, the quantity share of the firm $f$.
- Collusion: 
    - Under collusion, firms behave like a single monopoly.
    - Then, the marginal revenue is:
    $$
    QP'(Q) + P(Q).
    $$
    - Therefore, $\lambda = 1$.
- The identification of the mode of competition in this context is equivalent to the identification of $\lambda$, the __conduct parameter__.

### First-Order Condition

- Let $MC(q_f)$ be the marginal cost of firm $f$.
- Given the previous general marginal revenue function, the first-order condition for profit maximization for firm $f$ is written as:
\begin{equation}
\lambda Q P'(Q) + P(Q) = MC(q_f).
\end{equation}
- The system of equations for $f = 1, \cdots, F$ determine the market equilibrium.




### Linear Model

- To be simple, consider a linear inverse demand function:
\begin{equation}
P^D(Q) = \frac{\alpha_0}{\alpha_1} + \frac{1}{\alpha_1}Q + \frac{\alpha_2}{\alpha_1} X + \frac{1}{\alpha_1}u^D,
\end{equation}
where $X_t$ is a vector of observed demand sifters.
- Consider a linear marginal cost function:
\begin{equation}
MC(q_{f}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 q_{f} + \beta_2 W + u^S,
\end{equation}
where $W$ is a vector of observed cost sifters.




### Pricing Equation

- Inserting the inverse demand function and marginal cost function to the optimality condition:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\lambda}{\alpha_1} Q + P^S(Q) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 q_f + \beta_2 W + u^S
\end{equation}
- Summing them up and dividing by the number of firms $N$:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\lambda}{\alpha_1} Q + P^S(Q) = \beta_0 + \frac{\beta_1}{N} Q + \beta_2 W_t + u^S,
\end{equation}
- This determines the aggregate pricing equation:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
P^S(Q) &= \beta_0 + (\frac{\beta_1}{N} - \frac{\lambda}{\alpha_1})Q + \beta_2 W + u^S\\
&= \beta_0 + \gamma Q + \beta_2 W + u^S.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
- The key parameter is:
\begin{equation}
\gamma \equiv \frac{\beta_1}{N} - \frac{\lambda}{\alpha_1}.
\end{equation}



### Identification of Inverse Demand Function and Pricing Equation

- We have two systems of __reduced-form__ equations:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
&P^D(Q) = \frac{\alpha_0}{\alpha_1} + \frac{1}{\alpha_1}Q + \frac{\alpha_2}{\alpha_1} X + \frac{1}{\alpha_1}u^D,\\
&P^S(Q) = \beta_0 + \gamma Q + \beta_2 W + u^S.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
- If we observe a __demand shifter__ $X$, then it can be used as an instrument for $Q$ in the pricing equation to identify the parameters in the pricing equation.
- If we observe a __cost shifter__ $W_t$, then it can be used as an instrument for $Q$ in the inverse demand function to identify the parameters in the pricing equation.
- Thus, we can identify the __reduced-form parameters__ $(\alpha_0, \alpha_1, \alpha_2)$ and $(\beta_0, \gamma, \beta_2)$ if we observe a demand shifter $X$ and a cost shifter $W$.
- However, this is not enough to separately identify the __structural-form parameters__ $\beta_1$ and $\lambda$ in $\gamma$.

### The Conduct Parameter is Unidentified
- Even if the demand function and pricing equation (supply function) are identified, we still cannot identify the conduct parameter $\lambda$.
- The price at a quantity may be high either because of the high marginal cost or because of the high markup.
- Remember that the identification of $\gamma$ and $\alpha_1$ do not determine the value of $\lambda$ and $\beta_1$ in:
\begin{equation}
\gamma = \frac{\beta_1}{N} - \frac{\lambda}{\alpha_1}.
\end{equation}
- $\beta_1$ is the derivative of the marginal cost.

knitr::include_graphics("figuretable/demandshift.png")
```

### Identification of the Conduct Parameter: When Cost Data is Available

- If there is reliable cost data, we can directly identify the marginal cost function:
\begin{equation}
MC(q_f) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 q_f + \beta_2 W + u^S,
\end{equation}
and so $\beta_1$.
- Then, in a combination with the identification of inverse demand function and pricing equation, $\lambda$ is identified as:
\begin{equation}
\lambda = \alpha_1 \left(\frac{\beta_1}{N} - \gamma\right).
\end{equation}



### Identification of the Conduct Parameter: When Cost Data is Not Available

- Remember the first-order condition:
\begin{equation}
\lambda Q P^{D\prime}(Q) + P^S(Q) = MC(q_f),
\end{equation}
where we can identify $P^D(Q)$ and $P^S(Q)$ if we have demand and cost shifters.
- It is clear from this expression that we need a variation in $P^{D\prime}(Q)$ with a fixed $Q$ to identify $\lambda$, i.e., something that rotates the inverse demand function.
- Intuition: If demand becomes more elastic, prices will decrease and quantity will increase in a market with a high degree of market power.



### Identification of the Conduct Parameter: Demand Rotater is Available

- Let's formalize the idea.
- To identify the conduct parameter, we needed a demand rotater:
\begin{equation}
P^D(Q) = \frac{\alpha_0}{\alpha_1} + \frac{1}{\alpha_1}Q + \frac{\alpha_2}{\alpha_1} X + \frac{\alpha_3}{\alpha_1} Q \underbrace{Z}_{\text{demand rotater}} +  \frac{1}{\alpha_1}u^D.
\end{equation}
- Inserting this into the first-order condition yields:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\lambda}{\alpha} Q_t (1 + \alpha Z_t)+ P^S(Q) = \beta_0 + \frac{\beta_1}{N} Q + \beta_2 W + u^s,
\end{equation}
- This determines the pricing equation:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
P^S(Q) &= \beta_0 - \frac{\lambda}{\alpha_1} Q(1 + \alpha_3 Z_t) + \frac{\beta_1}{N} Q_t + \beta_2 W + u^S\\
&\equiv \beta_0 + \gamma_1 Q + \gamma_2 Z Q + \beta_2 W + u^S,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}
\gamma_1 \equiv \frac{\beta_1}{N} - \frac{\lambda}{\alpha_1}, \gamma_2 \equiv - \frac{\lambda \alpha_3}{\alpha_1}.
\end{equation}
### Identification of the Conduct Parameters: Demand Rotater is Available

- If we have cost shifters $W$, it can be used as instruments for $Q$ in the inverse demand function to identify the demand parameters $(\alpha_0, \alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3)$.
- If we have demand shifters $X$, it can be used as instruments for $Q$ in the pricing equation to identify the supply parameters $(\beta_0, \gamma_1, \gamma_2, \beta_2)$.
- Now we can identify the __reduced-form__ parameters $\alpha_1, \alpha_3$ and $\gamma_2$.
- Then, we can not identify the conduct parameter:
\begin{equation}
\lambda = - \frac{\gamma_2 \alpha_1}{\alpha_3}.
\end{equation}

### Identification of Conduct in Differentiated Product Market

- Consider the identification of conduct when there are two differentiated substitutable products and companies compete in price [@Nevo1998].
- Are the prices determined independently or jointly?
- The general first-order condition is:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
&(p_1 - c_1) \frac{\partial Q_1(p)}{\partial p_1} + Q_1^S(p) + \Delta_{12}(p_2 - c_2) \frac{\partial Q_2 (p)}{\partial p_1} = 0\\
&\Delta_{21}(p_1 - c_1)\frac{\partial Q_1(p)}{\partial p_2} + Q_2^S(p) + (p_2 - c_2) \frac{\partial Q_2 (p)}{\partial p_2} = 0,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where

- $\Delta_{12} = \Delta_{21} = 0$ if prices are determined independently.
- $\Delta_{12} = \Delta_{21} = 1$ if price are determined jointly. 

- Under what conditions can we identify $\Delta_{12}$ and $\Delta_{21}$?
- We will have to rotate $\frac{\partial Q_1(p)}{\partial p_2}$ and $\frac{\partial Q_2 (p)}{\partial p_1}$ while keeping the other variables at the same values.
- @Miller2017 infers $\Delta$ after the MillerCoors, a joint venture of SABMiller PLC and Molson Coors Brewing, is formed.
    - The unobserved year-specific and region-specific cost shocks are identified from the outsiders and the unobserved product-specific cost shocks are assumed to be the same before and after the merger.

## Merger Simulation

### Unilateral and Coordinated Effects of a Horizontal Merger

- There are two effects associated with a merge episode:
1. __Unilateral effect__: 
    - The new merged firm usually have a unilateral incentive to raise prices above their pre-merger level.
    - This unilateral effect may lead to the other firms to have an unilateral incentive to raise price, and the reaction continues to reach the new equilibrium.
    - The latter chain reaction is sometimes called the __multi-lateral effect__.
    - In economic theory, it is the price change when the same mode of competition (say, the Bertrand-Nash equilibrium) is played.
    - $\Delta$ is either 0 or 1: firms internalize the profits from owned product but do not internalize the other products.
1. __Coordinated effect__:
    - After the merger, the mode of competition may change. 
    - For example, the tacit collusion becomes easier and it can happen.
    - This effect, caused by the change in the mode of competition, is called the coordinated effect of a merger.
    - In this case, the conduct parameters $\Delta$ may take positive values for products owned by the rival firms.

### Merger Simulation

- In merger simulation, we compute the equilibrium under different ownership structure.
- This amounts to run a counterfactual simulation hypothetically changing the conduct parameter $\Delta$.
- The idea stems back to @Farrell1990, @Werden1994, @Hausman1994.
- Before running the simulation, you have to be very careful about the model assumptions:
    - In music industry, firms compete not in price but in advertisement.
    - If technological diffusion is important, firms may set dynamic pricing.
- This is the first __counterfactual analysis__ we study in this lecture.
- The results are valid only if the modeling assumptions are correct.

### Quantifying the Unilateral Effect

- See @Nevo2000c and @Nevo2001.
- There are $J$ products, $\mathcal{J} = \{1, \cdots, J\}$.
- We can have multiple markets but we suppress the market index.
- Firm $f$ produces a set of products which we denote $\mathcal{J}_f \subset \mathcal{J}$.
- Let $mc_j$ be the constant marginal cost of producing good $j$.
- Thus assuming a separable cost function.
    - We can relax this assumption for the estimation.
    - However, once you admit that the costs can be non-separable, you will start to wonder what happens to the cost function if two firms merged and started to produce the two products that were previously produced by separate firms. 
- Let $D_j(p)$ be the demand for product $j$ when the price vector is $p$.
- The problem for firm $f$ given the price of other firms $p_{-f}$ is:
\begin{equation}
\max_{p_f} \sum_{j \in \mathcal{J}_f} \Pi_j(p_f, p_{-f}) = \sum_{j \in \mathcal{J}_f} (p_j - mc_j) D_j(p_f, p_{-f}),
\end{equation}
where $p_f = \{p_j\}_{j \in \mathcal{J}_f}$, $p_{-f} = \{p_j\}_{j \in \mathcal{J} \setminus \mathcal{J}_f}$.

### Pre-Merger Equilibrium

- The first-order condition for firm $f$ is:
\begin{equation}
D_k(p) + \sum_{j \in \mathcal{J}_f} (p_j - mc_j) \frac{\partial D_j(p)}{\partial p_k} = 0, \forall k \in \mathcal{J}_f.
\end{equation}
- Let $\Delta_{jk}^{pre}$ takes 1 if same firm produces $j$ and $k$ and 0 otherwise before the merger.
- The first-order condition can be written as:
\begin{equation}
D_k(p) + \sum_{j \in \mathcal{J}} \Delta_{jk}^{pre}(p_j - mc_j) \frac{\partial D_j(p)}{\partial p_k} = 0, \forall k \in \mathcal{J}_f.
\end{equation}
- In terms of the product share:
\begin{equation}
s_k(p) + \sum_{j \in \mathcal{J}} \Delta_{jk}^{pre}(p_j - mc_j) \frac{\partial s_j(p)}{\partial p_k} = 0, \forall k \in \mathcal{J}_f.
\end{equation}
- Let $\Delta^{pre}$ be a $J \times J$ matrix whose $(j, k)$-element is $\Delta_{jk}$.
- At the end of the day, performing a merger simulation is to recompute the equilibrium with different ownership structure encoded in $\Delta$. 

### Post-Merger Equilibrium

- Let $\Omega^{pre}(p)$ is a matrix whose $(j, k)$-element is:

\begin{equation}
- \frac{\partial s_{j}(p)}{\partial p_k} \Delta_{jk}^{pre}.
\end{equation}

- Then, by the first-order condition, the marginal cost should be:
\begin{equation}
mc = p - \Omega^{pre}(p)^{-1} s(p).
\end{equation}

- If the ownership structure $\Delta^{pre}$ is changed to $\Delta^{post}$, and $\Omega^{pre}$ changed to $\Omega^{post}$, the post-merger price is determined by solving the non-linear equation:
\begin{equation}
p^{post} = mc + \Omega^{post}(p^{post})^{-1}s(p^{post}).
\end{equation}
- The post-merger share is given by:
\begin{equation}
s^{post} = s(p^{post}).
\end{equation}

### Consumer Surplus

- Suppose that the demand function is based on the mixed-logit model such that the indirect utility is:
\begin{equation}
u_{ijt} = x_{jt} \beta_i + \alpha_i p_{jt} + \xi_{j} + \xi_t + \Delta \xi_{jt} + \epsilon_{ijt},
\end{equation}
with $\epsilon_{ijt}$ is drawn from i.i.d. Type-I extreme value distribution and the consumer-level heterogeneity:

\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}
\alpha_i \\
\beta_i
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
\alpha\\
\beta
\end{pmatrix}
+ \Pi z_i + \Sigma \nu_i, \nu_i \sim N(0, I_{K + 1}).
\end{equation}

- Then, the compensated variation due to the price change for consumer $i$ is:
\begin{equation}
CV_{it} = \frac{\ln (\sum_{j = 0}^J \exp(V_{ijt}^{post}) ) - \ln (\sum_{j = 0}^J \exp(V_{ijt}^{pre})) }{\alpha_i},
\end{equation}
where $V_{ijt}^{post}$ and $V_{ijt}^{pre}$ are indirect utility for consumer $i$ to purchase good $j$ at the prices after and before the merger.
- This formula holds only if the price enters linearly in the indirect utility (no income effect).
- For general case, see @Small1981 and @Mcfadden1995.


### Quantifying the Coordinated Effect

- The repeated-game theory suggests that a collusion is sustainable if and only if it it incentive compatible: the collusion profit is no less than the deviation profit for each member of the collusion.
- The theory provides a check list that affects the incentive compatibility such as the market share, cost asymmetry, and demand dynamics.
- But it is often hard to judge the coordinated effects from these qualitative information, because mergers simultaneously change many factors and the factors may encourage or hinder collusion.
- @Miller2017 __retrospectively__ studies the coordinated effect of a merger.
- Is __prospective__ analysis of coordinated effects possible as well as the analysis of unilateral effects?
- If we can identify the demand and cost functions, we can calculate the collusion profits and deviation profits.
- If we specify the collusion strategy, we can write down the incentive compatibility.
- We can check how the incentive compatibility change when a hypothetical merger happens.
- The problem is the identification of conduct: to identify the cost function, we need to know the conduct.
- Thus, the stated strategy will work only if we have a data during which we are sure that there was no collusion, or there was a particular type of collusion.
- @Igami2018 use the detailed information of vitamin C cartel case and apply this approach.
