# Entry and Exit {#entryexit}

## Motivations

- By studying the entry decisions of firms, we can identify the profit function including the entry cost of firms.
- A profit function is the reduced-form parameter of the underlying demand function, cost function, and conduct parameters.
- The profit function can be identified without assuming a particular conduct.
- The parameter is informative enough to answer questions regarding the market structure and producer surplus.
- In the last chapter, we discussed the identification of conduct, in which we learned that the exogenous change in the number of firms in a market gives some information about the conduct.
- In the entry/exit analysis, we study the relationship between the market size, which exogenously changes the equilibrium number of firms, and the change in the market structure to infer the conduct.
- Entry and exit is not all about firms.
- The decision of launching a product is a sort of entry decision and the decision of abolishing a product is a sort of exit decision.
- The framework in this chapter can be applied to a wider class of problems. 
- This chapter is mostly based on @berryIdentificationModelsOligopoly2006.

### Entry Cost, Mode of Competition, and Market Structure

- Fixed and sunk entry costs and mode of competition are key determinants for market structure [@suttonChapter35Market2007]. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Figure 1 of Sutton (2007)', out.width='80%', fig.asp = .75, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figuretable/entrycost.png")
```


- The tougher the mode of competition, the less firms can earn enough profit to compensate the entry cost.
- Therefore, the tougher the mode of competition, the number of firms in the market in the equilibrium cannot grow when the market size increases.

### Exogenous and Endogenous Entry Cost

- __Exogenous fixed and sunk entry cost__: 
- The cost of entry is the same across modes of entry.
- __Endogenous fixed and sunk entry cost__: 
- The cost differs across modes of entry.
- For example, firms decide the quality of the product upon entering the market and the the cost of entry is increasing in the quality choice.
- If endogenous fixed and sunk entry cost is relevant, the entry cost to compete with the incumbent and have a positive profit will increase as the the number of incumbent firms increases.
- Therefore, the equilibrium firm number will be small and firm size will be large when endogenous fixed and sunk entry cost is relevant.

## Monopoly Entry

### Variable Profits and Fixed Costs

- Consider a cross-section of markets, with one potential entrant in each market.
- Profits in market $i$ are given by:
$$
\pi(x_i, F_i) \equiv v(x_i) - F_i.
$$
- $v(x)$ is deterministic and $F$ is random.
- Typically, $v(x)$ is interpreted as the variable profits and $F$ as the fixed costs.
- The potential entrant will enter market $i$ if and only if:
$$
F_i \le v(x_i).
$$

- The parameters of interest are $v$ and the distribution of $F$, $\Phi$.
- In general, $F$ in a market can be correlated with $x$. 

### Non-Identification

- Assume that $F$ is independent of $x$.
- Notice that a monotonic transformation of both sides of:
$$
F_i \le v(x_i).
$$
will not change the entry probability.
- Therefore, without further restrictions, $v$ and $\Psi$ are at best identified only up to a monotonic transformation.

### Restrictions for Identification.

- Keep assuming that $F$ is independent of $x$.
- Let $p(x)$ is the observed entry probability at $x$.
1. $v$ is known: Because $v$ is the variable profit function, we can identify it directly from the demand function and cost function. 
    - Let $z = v(x)$. Then $\Psi$ is identified at $z$ by:
    $$
    \Psi(z)  = \mathbb{P}\{F \le z\} = \mathbb{P}\{F \le v[v^{-1}(z)]\} = p[v^{- 1}(z)].
    $$
2. $\Psi$ is known: Normalize the distribution of $F$.
    - Then, $v$ is identified at $x$ by:
    $$
    v(x) = \Psi^{-1}[p(x)].
    $$
3. Impose shape restrictions on $v$ [@matzkinNonparametricDistributionFreeEstimation1992]:
    - $v(x)$ is homogeneous of degree 1 and there exists $x_0$ such that $v(x_0) = 1$. Then the functions $v$ and $\Psi$ are identified.
    - Homogeneous of degree 1: $v(z \cdot x) = z v(x)$.
    - Let $p(z, x_0)$ be the probability of entry at $z$ and $x_0$.
    - Then, $\Psi$ is identified at $z$ by:
    $$
    \Psi(z) = \mathbb{P}\{F \le z\} = \mathbb{P}\{F \le z v(x_0)\} = p(z, x_0).
    $$
    - Then, $v$ is identified by the second argument.
    
### Homogeneous of Degree 1 Variable Profits

- Sufficient condition for the variable profit function to satisfy the stated condition:
    - Demand is proportional to the population.
    - Marginal cost is constant.
    - Then, the variable profit is the market size $z$ times the per-capita profit.
    - We can normalize $v$ at a market of size $z = 1$ by choosing arbitrary $x_0$.

## Complete-Information Homogeneous Oligopoly Entry 

### Variable and Fixed Costs

- @bresnahanEntryCompetitionConcentrated1991 pioneered the analysis of oligopoly entry models.
- We observe a cross-section of markets in which we observe the number of homogeneous firms and other market-specific characteristics.
- Let $y_m$ be the number of firms in market $m$.
- Let $v_{y_m}(x_m)$ is the variable profit per firm in a market with number of firms $y_m$ and the market characteristics $x_m$.
- Let $F_m$ be the market-specific fixed costs that are i.i.d. across markets with unknown distribution $\Psi$.
- If there are $y_m$ firms in market $m$, the profit per firm in the market is:
$$
\pi(y_m, x_m, F_m) \equiv v_{y_m}(x_m) - F_m.
$$

### Equilibrium Condition

- The unique Nash equilibrium in the number of firms in market $m$ is determined by the following equilibrium condition:
$$
v_{y_m}(x_m) \ge F_m.
$$
$$
v_{y_m + 1}(x_m) < F_m.
$$

- Under this equilibrium, the probability of observing $y$ firms in a market of type $x$ is:
$$
\mathbb{P}\{y = 0|x\} = 1 - \Psi[v_1(x)].
$$
$$
\mathbb{P}\{y = 1|x\} = \Psi[v_1(x)] - \Psi[v_2(x)].
$$
$$
\mathbb{P}\{y = 2|x\} = \Psi[v_2(x)] - \Psi[v_3(x)].
$$
$$
\cdots
$$

- In other words, the probability of observing at least $y$ firms in a market of type $x$ is:
$$
\mathbb{P}\{y \ge 1|x\} = \Psi[v_1(x)].
$$
$$
\mathbb{P}\{y \ge 2|x\} = \Psi[v_2(x)].
$$
$$
\mathbb{P}\{y \ge 3|x\} = \Psi[v_3(x)].
$$
$$
\cdots
$$

### Identification under a Shape Restriction

- The identification argument for each $y$ is the same as the monopoly entry case.
- For example, assume $v_y(x) = z v_y(\tilde{x})$ and $v_1(\tilde{x}_0) = 1$.
- Let $P_y(z, \tilde{x})$ be the observed probability that the number of firms is no less than $y$ in market of type $z,  \tilde{x}$.
- Then $\Psi$ is identified at $z$ by:
$$
\Psi(z) = \mathbb{P}\{F \le z\} = \mathbb{P}\{F \le z v_1(\tilde{x}_0)\} = P_1(z, \tilde{x}_0).
$$
- Then, the identification of $v_y$ follows from:
$$
v_y(\tilde{x}) = \frac{\Psi^{-1}[P_y(z, \tilde{x})]}{z}.
$$

### Log Likelihood Function

- The log likelihood of observing $\{y_m\}_{m = 1}^M$ given $\{x_m\}_{m = 1}^M$ is:
$$
l(v, \Psi|\{y_m\}_{m = 1}^M,  \{x_m\}_{m = 1}^M) = \sum_{m = 1}^M \log\{\Psi[v_{y_m}(x_m)] - \Psi[v_{y_m + 1}(x_m)]\}.
$$
- This is a __ordered__ model in $y_m$.
- If $\Psi$ is a normal distribution, it is called an __ordered probit model__.

## Complete-Information Heterogeneous Oligopoly Entry

### Bivartiate Game with Heterogeneous Profits

- We observe a cross-section of markets in which there are two potential entrants.
- Let the profit of firm $i$ in market $m$ be:
$$
\begin{split}
\pi_{im}(x_{im}, y_{jm}, f_{im}) & \equiv v(y_{jm}, x_{im}) - f_{im}\\
&=v_{0i}(x_{im}) + y_{jm} v_{1i}(x_{im}) - f_{im}.
\end{split}
$$
- $y_{im}$ and $y_{jm}$ are the indicators of entry of firm $i$ and $j$ in market $m$.
- $x_{im}$ and $x_{jm}$ are firm $i$ and $j$'s characteristics in market $m$.
- $f_{im}$ and $f_{jm}$ are the fixed costs of firm $i$ and $j$ in market $m$.
- The second equation is without loss of generality because $y_{jm}$ is a binary variable.
- The competitive effect of firm $j$ on $i$ and the effect o firm $i$ on $j$ are asymmetric.
- The parameters of interest are $v_{0i}, v_{0j}, v_{1i}, v_{1j}$ and the joint distribution of $f_{im}, f_{jm}$ conditional on $x_{im}$ and $x_{jm}$.
- Firms __observe__ both $f_{im}, f_{jm}$ when they make decisions, but econometrician does not.

### Sampling Assumption and Observations

- We have a random sample of observations on markets where every observation is an observable realization of an equilibrium game played between firm $i$ and $j$.
- Thus, we can observe:
    - $\mathbb{P}\{0, 0|x\}$: the probability that a market of type $x$ has no firm.
    - $\mathbb{P}\{1, 0|x\}$: the probability that a market of type $x$ has firm $i$ but not firm $j$.
    - $\mathbb{P}\{0, 1|x\}$: the probability that a market of type $x$ has firm $j$ but not firm $i$.
    - $\mathbb{P}\{1, 1|x\}$: the probability that a market of type $x$ has both firms.
    
### Identification Assuming Pure-Strategy Equilibrium

- @tamerIncompleteSimultaneousDiscrete2003 considers the identification when there are only two potential entrants and the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium is assumed.
- Assume that the data is from a pure-strategy equilibrium.
- Then, the probabilities $\mathbb{P}\{0, 0|x\}$ and $\mathbb{P}\{1, 1|x\}$ are written as:
$$
\mathbb{P}\{0, 0|x\} = \mathbb{P}\{f_{im} \ge v_{0i}(x_{im}), f_{jm} \ge v_{0j}(x_{jm})|x_{im}, x_{jm}\}.
$$
$$
\mathbb{P}\{1, 1|x\} = \mathbb{P}\{f_{im} \le v_{0i}(x_{im}) + v_{1i}(x_{im}), f_{jm} \le v_{0j}(x_{jm}) + v_{1j}(x_{jm})|x_{im}, x_{jm}\}.
$$

- Assume that $(f_{im}, f_{jm})$ are distributed independently of $(x_{im}, x_{jm})$ with a joint distribution $F$.
- Assume that $v_{0i}(x_{im}) = z_{im} v_0(\tilde{x}_{im})$ and $v_{0j}(x_{jm}) = z_{jm} v_0(\tilde{x}_{jm})$.
- Assume that $v_{0i}(\tilde{x}_0) = v_{0j}(\tilde{x}_0) = 1$.
- Assume that $v_{1i}$ and $v_{1j}$ are non-positive.
- Assume that $z_{im}| z_{jm}, \tilde{x}_{im}, \tilde{x}_{jm}$ has a distribution with support on $\mathbb{R}$ and similar for $z_{jm}$.
- Then, $F$ is identified  by:
$$
\begin{split}
\mathbb{P}\{f_{im} \ge z_{im}, f_{jm} \ge z_{jm}\} &= \mathbb{P}\{ f_{im} \ge z_{im} v_0(\tilde{x}_{0}), f_{jm} \ge z_{jm} v_0(\tilde{x}_{0})\}\\
&= \mathbb{P}\{0, 0|z_{im}, \tilde{x}_0, z_{jm}, \tilde{x}_0\}.
\end{split}
$$
- Then, push $z_{jm} \to - \infty$ to get:
$$
\begin{split}
\mathbb{P}\{f_{im} \ge z_{im} v_0(\tilde{x}_{im})\} &= \lim_{z_{jm} \to - \infty} \mathbb{P}\{f_{im} \ge z_{im} v_0(x_{im}), f_{jm} \ge z_{jm} v_0(x_{jm})\}\\
&= \lim_{z_{jm} \to - \infty} \mathbb{P}\{0, 0|z_{im}, \tilde{x}_{im}, z_{jm}, \tilde{x}_{jm}\}
\end{split}
$$
- Hence, $v_{0}$ is identified by:
$$
v_0(\tilde{x}_{im}) = \frac{F^{-1}[\lim_{z_{jm} \to - \infty} \mathbb{P}\{0, 0|z_{im}, \tilde{x}_{im}, z_{jm}, \tilde{x}_{jm}\}]}{z_{im}}.
$$
- The identification of $v_{1i}$ and $v_{1j}$ are similar.

### Heterogeneous Independent Fixed Costs

- @berryEstimationModelEntry1992 considers several extensions to the homogeneous oligopoly models.
- Assume that the fixed costs are heterogeneous and independent across firms.
    - c.f. In homogeneous oligopoly model, the fixed costs were perfectly correlated across firms in a market.
- Assume that the characteristics can be firm-specific (that can include market-specific characteristics).
- Assume that the variable profit function is homogeneous:
$$
\pi_{y}(x_m, F_{im}) = v_y(x_{im}) - F_{im}.
$$
- Assume that $F$ is independent of $x$.
- Suppose that we observe the __number of potential entrants__ in each market.
- For example, in the airline industry, market is a city pair.
- The potential entrants into an airline city pair were those with some service out of at least one of the endpoints of the city pair.
- The variation in the number of potential entrants can be used to identify the model.
- Define:
$$
\mu(x) = \mathbb{P}\{F_{im} < v_1(x)\}.
$$
$$
\delta(x) = \mathbb{P}\{F_{im} < v_2(x)\}.
$$
- Suppose that we __know__ that there only two potential entrants into a market.
- Among such markets, we have:
$$
\mathbb{P}\{0, 0|x_1, x_2\} = [1 - \mu(x_1)] [1 - \mu(x_2)].
$$
$$
\mathbb{P}\{1, 1|x_1, x_2\} = \delta(x_1) \delta(x_2).
$$
- If we set $x_1 = x_2 = x$, then we have:
$$
\mathbb{P}\{0, 0|x, x\} = [1 - \mu(x)]^2.
$$
$$
\mathbb{P}\{1, 1|x, x\} = \delta(x)^2.
$$
- They identify $\mu$ and $\delta$ at $x$.
- Under shape restrictions, we can identify $v$ and $\Psi$ as well.

### Heterogenous and Market-Level Correlated Fixed Costs

- Let $\epsilon_m$ be the market-specific shock that affects the entry into market $m$.
- Conditional on $\epsilon_m$, $F_{im}$ are still independent across firms in a market.
- Let $\mu$ be:
$$
\mu(x, \epsilon_m) = \mathbb{P}\{F_{im} < v_1(x, \epsilon_m)\}.
$$
- When there is a market in which we __know__ that there are only two potential entrants, the probability of observing $(0, 0)$ becomes:
$$
\mathbb{P}\{0, 0|x_1, x_2\} = \int [1 - \mu(x_1, \epsilon_m)] [1 - \mu(x_2, \epsilon_m)] d \Gamma(\epsilon_m).
$$
- Specifically, assume that:
$$
\epsilon_m 
= 
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{   with probability   } \lambda \\
1 & \text{   with probability   } 1 - \lambda.
\end{cases}
$$

- Then, we in a market in which we __know__ that there are only two potential entrants, the probability of observing $(0, 0)$ becomes:
$$
\mathbb{P}\{0, 0|x_1, x_2\} = \lambda [1 - \mu(x_1, 0)] [1 - \mu(x_2, 0)] + (1 - \lambda) [1 - \mu(x_1, 1)] [1 - \mu(x_2, 1)].
$$
- In general, in a market in which we __know__ that there are only $K$ potential entrants such that $x_1 = \cdots x_K = x$, the probability of observing $(0, 0)$ becomes: 
$$
\mathbb{P}\{0, 0|x, \cdots x\} = \lambda [1 - \mu(x, 0)]^K + (1 - \lambda) [1 - \mu(x, 1)]^K.
$$
- If there markets with $K = 1, \cdots, \overline{K}$, we can construct $\overline{K}$ equations with three unknowns $\lambda$, $\mu(x, 0)$, and $\mu(x, 1)$.
- Thus, the knowledge and the variation in the number of potential entrants help the identification.


### Inference Based On a Unique Prediction 

- @berryEstimationModelEntry1992 develops a more general model built on the ideas above.
- The key for his analysis is that he ensures that __there is a unique number of equilibrium entrants__.
- This enables him to calculate the likelihood of observing a sequence of number of entrants, but at the cost of the generality of the underlying model.


### Entry in the Airline Industry: One-shot Game

- Based on @berryEstimationModelEntry1992.
- A market = a city pair market at a single point in time.
- Consider a one-shot entry game that yields a network structure.
- At the beginning of the period, each firm takes its overall network structure as given and decides whether to operate in a given city pair __independently__ across markets.


### Entry in the Airline Industry: Profit Function

- There are $K_m$ potential entrants in market $m$.
- Let $y_m$ be a strategy profile.
- $y_m = (y_{1m}, \cdots, y_{K_m m})'$, $y_{im} \in \{0, 1\}$.
- The profit function for firm $i$ in market $m$:
\begin{equation}
\pi_{im}(y_m, f_{im}) = v_m\left(N_{m}\right) - f_{im}.
\end{equation}
- $N_{m} = \sum_{i = 1}^{K_m} y_{im}$.
- $v_m$ is strictly decreasing in $N_m$.

### Entry in the Airline Industry: Profit Function

- The common term is assumed to be:
$$
v_m(N) = x_m' \beta + h(\delta, N_m) + \rho u_{m}, 
$$
- $x_m$ is the observed market characteristics, $h(\cdot)$ is a function that is decreasing in $N_m$, say, $- \delta \ln (N_m)$.
- $u_m$ is the market characteristics that is observed by firms but not by econometrician.
- The firm-specific term:
$$
f_{im} = z_{im}' \alpha + \sigma u_{im},
$$
- $z_{im}$ is the observed firm characteristics.
- A scale normalization: $\sigma = \sqrt{1 - \rho^2}$ $\Rightarrow var(\rho u_m + \sigma u_{im}) = 1$.

### Entry in the Airline Industry: Likelihood Function

- The observed part:
$$
r_{im}(N) = x_m' \beta - \delta \ln (N_m) + z_{im}' \alpha. 
$$
- The unobserved part:
$$
\epsilon_{im} = \sqrt{1 - \rho^2} u_{im} + \rho u_{m}.
$$
 

### Is the Equilibrium Number of Firms Unique?

- Either of the following conditions are sufficient: 
- No firm-level unobserved heterogeneity: $\rho = 1$.
- No market-level unobserved heterogeneity: $\rho = 0$.
- The order of entry is predetermined, for example, the most profitable firms enter first.
- The incumbent firms enter first.
- Under either of the above assumptions, simulate the equilibrium number of firms in each market and match with the data.


## Multiple Prediction

- If we further generalize the model, we will suffer from the problem of __multiple prediction__.
- First, even in @berryEstimationModelEntry1992's framework, the identity of entrants were not uniquely predicted.
- Second, if we allows for the asymmetric competitive effects, we will not have the unique number of equilibrium entrants.
- Third, the uniqueness of the equilibria may not hold once we allow for the mixed-strategy Nash equilibria.
- If we do not have the unique prediction on the endogenous variables, we cannot write down the likelihood function.

### Multiple Equilibria in Bivariate Game with Heterogenous Profits

- Return to @tamerIncompleteSimultaneousDiscrete2003's bivariate game with heterogeneous profits.
- Consider the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium when $f_{im}, f_{jm}$ are realized.
- $(0, 0)$ is a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium if:
$$
f_{im} \ge v_{0i}(x_{im});
$$
$$
f_{jm} \ge v_{0j}(x_{jm}).
$$
- $(1, 1)$ is a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium if:
$$
f_{im} \le v_{0i}(x_{im}) + v_{1i}(x_{im});
$$
$$
f_{jm} \le v_{0j}(x_{jm}) + v_{1j}(x_{jm}).
$$
- $(0, 1)$ is a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium if:
$$
f_{im} \ge v_{0i}(x_{im}) + v_{1i}(x_{im});
$$
$$
f_{jm} \le v_{0j}(x_{jm}).
$$
- $(1, 0)$ is a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium if:
$$
f_{im} \le v_{0i}(x_{im});
$$
$$
f_{jm} \ge v_{0j}(x_{jm}) + v_{1j}(x_{jm}).
$$
- In a certain region of $f_{im}, f_{jm}$, there are multiple equilibria.

### Multiple Prediction in Bivariate Game with Heterogenous Profits

- In the orange region, we have multiple pure-strategy equilibria.
- If we allow for mixed-strategy equilibria, the region of $f_{im}, f_{jm}$ on which there are multiple equilibria will increase.
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = '', out.width='80%', fig.asp = .75}
knitr::include_graphics("figuretable/bivariateentry.png")
```
- In this example, we can write the likelihood of the number of equilibrium entrants:
    - $2$: green area.
    - $1$: yellow, orange, and red areas.
    - $0$: blue area.
- However, we cannot write the likelihood of the strategy profile.
    - $(1, 1)$: green area.
    - $(0, 1)$: $\ge$ red area, $\le$ orange and red area.
    - $(1, 0)$: $\ge$ yellow area, $\le$ orange and yellow area.
    - $(0, 0)$: blue area.
    
### Inference Based on Moment Inequalities

- According to the theory, we have:
$$
\mathbb{P}\{0, 0|x\} = \mathbb{P}\{f_{i} \ge v_{0i}(x_{i}), f_{j} \ge v_{0j}(x_{j})\} \equiv H(0, 0|x).
$$

$$
\mathbb{P}\{1, 1|x\} = \mathbb{P}\{f_{i} \le v_{0i}(x_{i}) + v_{1i}(x_{i}), f_{j} \le v_{0j}(x_{j}) + v_{1j}(x_{j}) \} \equiv H(1, 1|x).
$$

$$
\mathbb{P}\{0, 1|x\} \ge \mathbb{P}\{f_{i} \ge v_{0i}, v_{0j} \ge f_{j} \ge v_{0j} + v_{1j}\} + \mathbb{P}\{f_{i} \ge v_{0i} + v_{1i}, f_{j} \le v_{0j} + v_{1j}\} \equiv \underline{H}(0, 1|x).
$$

$$
\mathbb{P}\{0, 1|x\} \le \underline{H}(0, 1|x) + \mathbb{P}\{v_{0i} + v_{1i} \le f_{i} \le v_{0i}, v_{0j} + v_{1j} \le f_{j} \le v_{0j}\} \equiv \overline{H}(0, 1|x).
$$


$$
\mathbb{P}\{1, 0|x\} \ge \mathbb{P}\{f_{j} \ge v_{0j}, f_{i} \le v_{0i}\} + \mathbb{P}\{ v_{0j} + v_{1j} \le f_{j} \le v_{0j}, f_{i} \le v_{0i} + v_{1i}\} \equiv \underline{H}(1, 0|x).
$$

$$
\mathbb{P}\{1, 0|x\} \le \underline{H}(0, 1|x) + \mathbb{P}\{v_{0i} + v_{1i} \le f_{i} \le v_{0i}, v_{0j} + v_{1j} \le f_{j} \le v_{0j}\} \equiv \overline{H}(1, 0|x).
$$

- The parameters should satisfy the moment conditions:
$$
\mathbb{P}\{0, 0|x\} - H(0, 0|x) = 0;
$$
$$
\mathbb{P}\{1, 1|x\} - H(1, 1|x) = 0;
$$
$$
\min\left\{\mathbb{P}\{0, 1|x\} - \underline{H}(0, 1|x), 0\right\} = 0;
$$
$$
\max\left\{\mathbb{P}\{0, 1|x\} - \overline{H}(0, 1|x), 0\right\} = 0;
$$
$$
\min\left\{\mathbb{P}\{1, 0|x\} - \underline{H}(1, 0|x), 0\right\} = 0;
$$
$$
\max\left\{\mathbb{P}\{1, 0|x\} - \overline{H}(1, 0|x), 0\right\} = 0;
$$
- We can estimate the parameters with the GMM method using the above modified moment conditions.
- Inference based on the moment inequalities are found in @andrewsInferenceParametersDefined2010.
- @cilibertoMarketStructureMultiple2009 study the entry exit of airlines when there are heterogeneous competitive effects using the above approach.

## Incompelete-Information Heterogenous Oligopoly Entry

### Bivariate Case

- There are two potential entrants.
- Let the profit of firm $i$ in market $m$ be:
$$
\begin{split}
\pi_{im}(x_{im}, y_{jm}, f_{im}) & \equiv v(y_{jm}, x_{im}) - f_{im}\\
&=v_{0i}(x_{im}) + y_{jm} v_{1i}(x_{im}) - f_{im}.
\end{split}
$$
- $y_{im}$ and $y_{jm}$ are the indicators of entry of firm $i$ and $j$ in market $m$.
- $x_{im}$ and $x_{jm}$ are firm $i$ and $j$'s characteristics in market $m$.
- $f_{im}$ and $f_{jm}$ are the fixed costs of firm $i$ and $j$ in market $m$.
- The second equation is without loss of generality because $y_{jm}$ is a binary variable.
- The competitive effect of firm $j$ on $i$ and the effect of firm $i$ on $j$ are asymmetric.
- The parameters of interest are $v_{0i}, v_{0j}, v_{1i}, v_{1j}$ and the joint distribution of $f_{im}, f_{jm}$ conditional on $x_{im}$ and $x_{jm}$.
- Firm $i$ __observe__ both $f_{im}$ but __not__ $f_{jm}$ when it makes decision.
- Firm $j$ __observe__ both $f_{jm}$ but __not__ $f_{im}$ when it makes decision.
- Econometrican does not observe either of them.
- The joint distribution of $f_{im}, f_{jm}$ is $F$ (independent of $x$).

### The Equilibrium Strategy and Belief

- The equilibrium strategy becomes a step function that decreases in a threshold:
$$
y_{im} = 1\{f_{im} \le t_{im}\}.
$$
$$
y_{jm} = 1\{f_{jm} \le t_{jm}\}.
$$
- Suppose that firm $i$ believes that $f_{jm}$ has a distribution of $G_{jm}^{im}$ and firm $j$ believes that $f_{im}$ has a distribution of $G_{im}^{jm}$.
- Usually, we assume a common and objective prior: $G_{jm}^{im}(\epsilon_{jm}) = F(\epsilon_{jm}|\epsilon_{im})$ and $G_{im}^{jm}(\epsilon_{im}) = F(\epsilon_{im}|\epsilon_{jm})$.
- When firm $j$ follows strategy $t_{jm}$, the expected payoff for firm $i$ to enter is:
$$
[v_{0i}(x_{im}) - f_{im}][1 - G_{jm}^{im}(t_{jm})] + [v_{0i}(x_{im}) + v_{1i}(x_{im}) - f_{im})] G_{jm}^{im}(t_{jm}).
$$
- Thus, the threshold $t_{im}$ is determined by:
$$
[v_{0i}(x_{im}) - t_{im}][1 - G_{jm}^{im}(t_{jm})] + [v_{0i}(x_{im}) + v_{1i}(x_{im}) - t_{im})] G_{jm}^{im}(t_{jm}) = 0.
$$
- In the same way, the threshold $t_{jm}$ is determined by:
$$
[v_{0j}(x_{jm}) - t_{jm}][1 - G_{im}^{jm}(t_{im})] + [v_{0j}(x_{jm}) + v_{1j}(x_{jm}) - t_{jm})] G_{im}^{jm}(t_{im}) = 0.
$$
- This system of equations can have multiple solution.

### Equilibrium Selection and Likelihood

- If we specify the equilibrium selection rule $\mathbb{P}(t_{im}, t_{jm}|x_{im}, x_{jm}, f_{im}, f_{jm})$, then we can specify the likelihood of observing $(0, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(1, 1)$.
- If we do not, we will only have bounds on the likelihood of observing $(0, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(1, 1)$.
- Another way is to assume that __the same equilibrium $t_{im}^*(x_{im}, x_{jm}), t_{jm}^*(x_{im}, x_{jm})$ holds across markets__.
- Then, the across market relative frequency of entries conditional on $x_{im}, x_{jm}$ gives the estimates of the entry probabilities:
$$
\widehat{G}_{im}(x_{im}, x_{jm}) \approx G_{im}^{jm}[t^*_{im}(x_{im}, x_{jm})],
$$
$$
\widehat{G}_{jm}(x_{im}, x_{jm}) \approx G_{jm}^{im}[t_{jm}^*(x_{im}, x_{jm})],
$$
for each $x_{im}, x_{jm}$.
- The estimated distribution has to solve:
$$
\widehat{G}_{im}(x_{im}, x_{jm}) = \mathbb{P}\{[v_{0i}(x_{im}) - f_{im}][1 - \widehat{G}_{jm}(x_{im}, x_{jm})] + [v_{0i}(x_{im}) + v_{1i}(x_{im}) - f_{im}] \widehat{G}_{jm}(x_{im}, x_{jm}) > 0\}.
$$
$$
\widehat{G}_{jm}(x_{im}, x_{jm}) = \mathbb{P}\{[v_{0j}(x_{jm}) - f_{jm}][1 - \widehat{G}_{im}(x_{im}, x_{jm})] + [v_{0j}(x_{jm}) + v_{1j}(x_{jm}) - f_{jm}] \widehat{G}_{im}(x_{im}, x_{jm}) > 0\}.
$$
- We find parameters $v_{0i}, v_{0j}, v_{1i}, v_{1j}, F$ that solve this system of equations.
- The "same equilibrium" assumption is hardly justified, but is often used in the empirical studies.
