  abstract = {We state a sufficient condition under which choice data alone suffices to identify consumer preferences when choices are not fully informed. Suppose that: (i) the data generating process is a search model in which the attribute hidden to consumers is observed by the econometrician; (ii) if a consumer searches good j, she also searches goods which are better than j in terms of the nonhidden component of utility; and (iii) consumers choose the good that maximizes overall utility among searched goods. Canonical models will be biased: the value of the hidden attribute will be understated because consumers will be unresponsive to variation in the attribute for goods that they do not search. Under the conditions above and additional mild restrictions, an alternative method of recovering preferences using cross derivatives of choice probabilities succeeds regardless of the search protocol and is thus robust to whether consumers are informed. The approach nests several standard models, including full information. Our methods suggest natural tests for full information and can be used to forecast how consumers will respond to additional information. We verify in a lab experiment that our approach succeeds in recovering preferences when consumers engage in costly search.},

In this paper we provide evidence that these correlations arise from a causal effect predicted by Schumpeterian growth theory\textemdash the threat of technologically advanced entry spurs innovation incentives in sectors close to the technology frontier, where successful innovation allows incumbents to survive the threat, but discourages innovation in laggard sectors, where the threat reduces incumbents' expected rents from innovating. We find that the empirical patterns hold using rich micro panel data for the United Kingdom. We control for the endogeneity of entry by exploiting major European and U.K. policy reforms, and allow for endogeneity of additional factors.

Our empirical results show that the most important factor to explain the adoption of hub-and-spoke networks is that the sunk cost of entry in a route declines importantly with the number of cities that the airline connects from the origin and destination airports of the route. For some carriers, the entry deterrence motive is the second most important factor to explain hub-and-spoke networks.},

Two main econometric issues appear in the estimation of these models: the indeterminacy problem associated with the existence of multiple equilibria and the computational burden in the solution of the game. We propose a class of pseudo maximum likelihood (PML) estimators that deals with these problems, and we study the asymptotic and finite sample properties of several estimators in this class. We first focus on two-step PML estimators, which, although they are attractive for their computational simplicity, have some important limitations: they are seriously biased in small samples; they require consistent nonparametric estimators of players' choice probabilities in the first step, which are not always available; and they are asymptotically inefficient. Second, we show that a recursive extension of the two-step PML, which we call nested pseudo likelihood (NPL), addresses those drawbacks at a relatively small additional computational cost. The NPL estimator is particularly useful in applications where consistent nonparametric estimates of choice probabilities either are not available or are very imprecise, e.g., models with permanent unobserved heterogeneity. Finally, we illustrate these methods in Monte Carlo experiments and in an empirical application to a model of firm entry and exit in oligopoly markets using Chilean data from several retail industries.]},

We use a choice probabilities representation of the discrete decision problem to derive marginal conditions of optimality with similar features as standard EEs in continuous decision problems. These EEs imply a \ldots xed point mapping in the space of conditional choice values, that we denote the EE operator. We show that this operator is a stronger contraction than both the standard and the relative value function operators. Solving the dynamic programming problem by iterating in the EE operator implies substantial computational savings compared to value function and relative value function iterations (that require a much larger number of iterations) and to policy function iterations (that involves a costly valuation step at every iteration). We de\ldots ne a sample version of the EE operator and use it to construct a sequence of consistent estimators of the structural parameters, and to evaluate counterfactual experiments. The computational cost of evaluating this sample-based EE operator increases linearly with sample size, and provides a consistent estimator of the counterfactual. As such there is no curse of dimensionality in the consistent estimation of the model and in the evaluation of counterfactual experiments. We illustrate the computational gains of our methods using Monte Carlo experiments.},

The huge heterogeneity in organizational structures persists even within relatively homogenous size classes. The diffusion of statistical models to assess credit risk (scoring) accelerated recently particularly among large banks, boosted by the new Basel Capital Accord. Scoring is either very important or determinant in decisions on credit extension while it is rarely influential in setting interest rates, the duration of the credit, and the amount and type of collateral required.

The theory points to the relationships that contain information on the unobserved demand factor, such as the pric ing equation and the advertising equation. The authors' approach is an alternative to Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes's (1995) product-market con trols for unobserved quality. The authors apply both methods to examine households' choices among television options, including basic and pre mium cable packages, in which unobserved attributes, such as quality of programming, are expected to be correlated with price. Without correcting for endogeneity, aggregate demand is estimated to be upward-sloping, suggesting that omitted attributes are positively correlated with demand. Both the control function method and the product-market controls method produce downward-sloping demand estimates that are similar.},

GMS procedures are shown to have correct asymptotic size in a uniform sense and are shown not to be asymptotically conservative. The power of GMS tests is compared to that of subsampling, m out of n bootstrap, and ``plug-in asymptotic'' (PA) tests. The latter three procedures are the only general procedures in the literature that have been shown to have correct asymptotic size (in a uniform sense) for the moment inequality/equality model. GMS tests are shown to have asymptotic power that dominates that of subsampling, m out of n bootstrap, and PA tests. Subsampling and m out of n bootstrap tests are shown to have asymptotic power that dominates that of PA tests.},

  abstract = {Increasingly, user-generated product reviews serve as a valuable source of information for customers making product choices online. The existing literature typically incorporates the impact of product reviews on sales based on numeric variables representing the valence and volume of reviews. In this paper, we posit that the information embedded in product reviews cannot be captured by a single scalar value. Rather, we argue that product reviews are multifaceted, and hence the textual content of product reviews is an important determinant of consumers' choices, over and above the valence and volume of reviews. To demonstrate this, we use text mining to incorporate review text in a consumer choice model by decomposing textual reviews into segments describing different product features. We estimate our model based on a unique data set from Amazon contain-ing sales data and consumer review data for two different groups of products (digital cameras and camcorders) over a 15-month period. We alleviate the problems of data sparsity and of omitted variables by providing two experimental techniques: clustering rare textual opinions based on pointwise mutual information and using externally imposed review semantics. This paper demonstrates how textual data can be used to learn consumers' relative preferences for different product features and also how text can be used for predictive modeling of future changes in sales.},

The simplest model\textemdash symmetric independent private values\textemdash is nonparametrically identified even if only the transaction price from each auction is observed. For richer models, identification and testable restrictions may be obtained when additional information of one or more of the following types is available: (i) the identity of the winning bidder or other bidders; (ii) one or more bids in addition to the transaction price; (iii) exogenous variation in the number of bidders; (iv) bidder\textendash specific covariates. While many private values (PV) models are nonparametrically identified and testable with commonly available data, identification of common values (CV) models requires stringent assumptions.

We document that nonlinear pricing in the form of quantity discounts is common, that quantity discounts are sizable for basic staples, and that the well-known conditional cash transfer program Progresa has significantly increased quantity discounts, although the program, as documented in previous studies, has not affected unit prices on average. To account for these patterns, we propose a model of price discrimination that nests those of Maskin and Riley (1984) and Jullien (2000), in which consumers differ in their tastes and, because of subsistence constraints, in their ability to pay for a good. We show that under mild conditions, a model in which consumers face heterogeneous subsistence or budget constraints is equivalent to one in which consumers have access to heterogeneous outside options. We rely on known results to characterize the equilibrium price schedule, which is nonlinear in quantity. We analyze the effect of nonlinear pricing on market participation as well as the impact of a market-wide transfer, analogous to the Progresa one, when consumers are differentially constrained. We show that the model is structurally identified from data on prices and quantities from a single market under common assumptions. We estimate the model using data on three commonly consumed commodities from municipalities and localities in Mexico. Interestingly, we find that relative to linear pricing, nonlinear pricing is beneficial to a large number of households, including those consuming small quantities, mostly because of the higher degree of market participation that nonlinear pricing induces. We also show that the Progresa transfer has affected the slopes of the price schedules of the three commodities we study, which have become steeper as consistent with our model, leading to an increase in the intensity of price discrimination. Finally, we find that a reduced form of our model, in which the size of quantity discounts depends on the hazard rate of the distribution of quantities purchased in a village, accounts for the shift in price schedules induced by the program.},

Yet when there are multiple sectors, due to an intersectoral pecuniary externality, an increase in common ownership could stimulate the economy when the elasticity of labor supply is high relative to the elasticity of substitution in product markets. We characterize for which ownership structures the monopolistically competitive limit or an oligopolistic one are attained as the number of sectors in the economy increases.

First, households are willing to pay less than 1 percent more in house prices-substantially lower than previous estimates-when the average performance of the local school increases by 5 percent. Second, much of the apparent willingness to pay for more educated and wealthier neighbors is explained by the correlation of these sociodemographic measures with unobserved neighborhood quality. Third, neighborhood race is not capitalized directly into housing prices; instead, the negative correlation of neighborhood percent black and housing prices is due entirely to the fact that blacks live in unobservably lower-quality neighborhoods. Finally, there is considerable heterogeneity in preferences for schools and neighbors, with households preferring to self-segregate on the basis of both race and education.}

To understand the effects of lenders' pricing strategies on market equilibrium, we develop and estimate a structural model of mortgage choice and lender competition in which borrowers may have different elasticities to rates and fees.

Taking account of revenue recycling, the impact of a 25-cent gasoline tax increase on the average household is about \$30 per year (2001 dollars). Distributional impacts depend importantly on how additional revenues from the tax increase are recycled. (JEL D12, H22, H25, L62, L71)},

  abstract = {Digital platforms such as Facebook create value by connecting users, vendors, and contractors. Their strong supply and demand economies of scale can give them market power, and have led to increasing calls for special regulations and taxes. We construct and illustrate an approach for structural modeling of digital platforms. The model allows for heterogeneity in demand elasticity, disutility from advertising, and network effects across users. We paramaterize our model using a survey of over 57,000 US internet users on their demand for Facebook's eponymous application. Facebook creates \$14 billion in social value per month, with consumer surplus concentrated among female and older users of Facebook. The most valuable friendships on Facebook are worth in excess of 50 cents per month, but most are worth far less, with connections to men more valuable on a per-friend basis. We find that Facebook has too low a level of advertising relative to their short-term profit maximizing strategy. Imputing their shadow value from maintaining a large user base, we estimate that the welfare lost from Facebook's market power, compared to the first best of a social welfare maximizing Facebook, is 9.6\% of current social value, or \$1.3 Billion per month. We then simulate six proposed policies for government management of digital platforms, taking Facebook's optimal response into account. Taxes are mostly incident on Facebook profit and properly targeted taxes can even raise consumer surplus. Achieving perfect competition in social media would raise social surplus from Facebook by 4.8\% of current value. But a botched regulation that left the US with two smaller, non-competitive social media monopolies would decrease social surplus by 84.7\%.},

Rather, identification relies primarily on the standard requirement that instruments be available for the endogenous variables-here, typically, prices and quantities. We discuss the types of instruments that can suffice, as well as how instrumental variables requirements can be relaxed by the availability of individual-level data or through restrictions on preferences. We also review new results on discrimination between alternative models of oligopoly competition. Together, these results reveal a strong nonparametric foundation for a broad applied literature, provide practical guidance for applied work, and may suggest new approaches to estimation and testing.},

We study simple versions of both static and dynamic entry models. For simple static models, we show how natural shape restrictions can be used to identify competition effects. We consider extensions to models with heterogeneous firms, mixed-strategy equilibria and private information and provide insights that can be used in these settings to conduct inference. In the case of dynamic models, we review existing results on the model with i.i.d. linear errors, and then consider more realistic cases, such as when the distribution of fixed costs is unknown. 1},

We detail the shortcomings of papers that rely on discredited approaches from the "structure-conduct-performance" literature. In contrast, papers based on production function estimation have made useful progress in measuring broad trends in markups. However, industries are so heterogeneous that careful industry specific studies are also required, and sorely needed. Examples of such studies illustrate differing explanations for rising markups, including endogenous increases in fixed cost associated with lower marginal costs. In some industries there is evidence of price increases driven by mergers. To fully understand markups, we must eventually recover the key economic primitives of demand, marginal cost, and fixed and sunk costs. We end by discussing the various aspects of antitrust enforcement that may be of increasing importance regardless of the cause of increased markups.},

The purpose is to identify the set of margins compatible with the margins obtained from estimates of cost and to select the model most consistent with the data among non-nested competing models. The models considered are (1) a simple linear pricing model; (2) a vertically integrated model; and (3) a variety of alternative (strategic) supply scenarios that allow for collusion, non-linear pricing, and strategic behaviour with respect to private label products. Using data on yogurt sold in several stores in a large urban area of the U.S. the results imply that wholesale prices are close to marginal cost and that retailers have pricing power in the vertical chain. This is consistent with non-linear pricing by the manufacturers or high bargaining power of the retailers.},

In some cases, marginal valuations are point identified, and in other cases, we can only recover bounds. Where the conditions fail, we highlight the role which the introduction of unobserved product attributes can play in rationalizing the data.

In this paper we use a combination of reduced-form techniques and structural analysis to characterize and measure experimentation motives for trade in the U.S. secondary market for municipal bonds. First, we provide reduced-form evidence that experimentation is a first-order motive for trade. To rationalize these facts, we design a dynamic model of trade in this market that allows for linkages between trading activity and information acquisition (i.e., experimentation). The model is estimated using detailed micro-data on trading activity on the secondary market for municipal bonds. We use the model to characterize the incentives to experiment. We find that dealers are willing to pay up to 15\% of the intermediation spread to double the precision of their information about the state of fundamentals. Furthermore, we show that experimentation allows dealers to increase the precision of their estimate of the asset's value by 25\%, and we characterize the process of information diffusion across agents. Finally, we find that experimentation explains up to 10\% of the volume of trade in the market.},

For our preferred estimate, which adjusts for a number of potential sources of measurement error and bias, the weighted average annual productivity growth for incumbents is 2.85\% for a gross output production function and 7.96\% for a value added production function over the period 1998\textendash 2007. This is among the highest compared to other countries. Productivity growth at the industry level is even higher, reflecting the dynamic force of creative destruction. Over the entire period, net entry accounts for over two thirds of total TFP growth. In contrast to earlier studies looking at total non-agriculture including services, we find that TFP growth dominates input accumulation as a source of output growth.},

Second, pro-competitive effects are most important among incumbents, while efficiency gains dominate for new entrants. Third, cuts in input tariffs raise both markups and productivity. We highlight mechanisms that explain these findings in the Chinese context.},

These analytical results structure our empirical analysis of competition in five retail and professional industries. Using data on geographically isolated monopolies, duopolies, and oligopolies, we study the relationship between the number of firms in a market, market size, and competition. Our empirical results suggest that competitive conduct changes quickly as the number of incumbents increases. In markets with five or fewer incumbents, almost all variation in competitive conduct occurs with the entry of the second or third firm. Surprisingly, once the market has between three and five firms, the next entrant has little effect on competitive conduct.},

In spite of the general use of love-of-variety models, there has been no systematic study of how the import of new varieties has contributed to national welfare gains in the United States. In this paper, we show that the unmeasured growth in product variety from U.S. imports has been an important source of gains from trade over the last three decades (1972-2001). Using extremely disaggregated data, we show that the number of imported product varieties has increased by a factor of four. We also estimate the elasticities of substitution for each available category at the same level of aggregation and describe their behavior across time and SITC-5 industries. Using these estimates, we develop an exact price index and find that the upward bias in the conventional import price index is approximately 1.2 percent per year. The magnitude of this bias suggests that the welfare gains from variety growth in imports alone are 2.8 percent of GDP.},

The high prices are sustained by collusive strategies with a finite phase of punishment followed by a gradual return to cooperation.

Moreover, we find a significant, albeit small, effect of the reputation of the critics on their strategies, indicating that incentives to manipulate demand in order to prevent reputation updating are present in this industry. Our estimation takes into account and quantifies potential conflicts of interest that might arise when the movie critic belongs to the same media outlet as the film under review.

We develop a multistep semiparametric method and we show that our semiparametric estimator of the utility function parameter(s) converges at the optimal rate, which is slower than the parametric one but independent of the dimension of the exogenous variables thereby avoiding the curse of dimensionality. We then consider various extensions including a binding reserve price, affiliation among private values, and asymmetric bidders.

Thus, quite complicated variance structures can be generated by recur-sively adding components having this new distribution, and the result will retain a marginal extreme-value (logistic) distribution. It is demonstrated that the computational simplicity of extreme-value error structures extends to the introduction of heterogeneity in duration, selection bias, limited-dependent-and qualitative-variable models. The usefulness of these new classes of distributions is illustrated with the examples of nested logit, multivariate risk, and competing risk models, where important generalizations to conventional stochastic structures are developed. The new models are shown to be computationally simpler and far more tractable than alternatives such as estimation by simulated moments. These results will be of considerable use to applied microeconomic researchers who have been hampered by computational difficulties in constructing more sophisticated estimators.},

We use bidding data from the European Central Bank's auctions for one-week loans, their main channel of monetary policy implementation. Our analysis provides a high-frequency, disaggregated perspective on the 2007 crisis, which was previously studied through comparisons of collateralized and uncollateralized interbank money market rates which do not capture the heterogeneous impact of the crisis on individual banks. Through a model of bidding, we show that banks' bids reflect their cost of obtaining short-term funds elsewhere (e.g., in the interbank market) as well as a strategic response to other bidders. The strategic response is empirically important: while a na\"ive interpretation of the raw bidding data may suggest that virtually all banks suffered an increase in the cost of short-term funding, we find that, for about one third of the banks, the change in bidding behavior was simply a strategic response. We also find considerable heterogeneity in the short-term funding costs among banks: for over one third of the bidders, funding costs increased by more than 20 basis points, and funding costs vary widely with respect to the country-of-origin. The funding costs we estimate using bidding data are also predictive of market- and accounting-based measures of bank performance, reinforcing the usefulness of ``revealed preference'' information contained in bids.},

The method of sieves provides one way to tackle such difficulties by optimizing an empirical criterion over a sequence of approximating parameter spaces (i.e., sieves); the sieves are less complex but are dense in the original space and the resulting optimization problem becomes well-posed. With different choices of criteria and sieves, the method of sieves is very flexible in estimating complicated semi-nonparametric models with (or without) endogeneity and latent heterogeneity. It can easily incorporate prior information and constraints, often derived from economic theory, such as monotonicity, convexity, additivity, multiplicity, exclusion and nonnegativity. It can simultaneously estimate the parametric and nonparametric parts in semi-nonparametric models, typically with optimal convergence rates for both parts. This chapter describes estimation of semi-nonparametric econometric models via the method of sieves. We present some general results on the large sample properties of the sieve estimates, including consistency of the sieve extremum estimates, convergence rates of the sieve M-estimates, pointwise normality of series estimates of regression functions, root-n asymptotic normality and efficiency of sieve estimates of smooth functionals of infinite-dimensional parameters. Examples are used to illustrate the general results.},

This paper examines whether and when state technical capabilities attract foreign investment in manufacturing from 1987-1993. We find that on average state R\&D intensity does not attract foreign direct investment. Most investing firms are in lower-tech industries and locate in low R\&D intensity states, suggesting little interest in state technical capabilities. In contrast , we find that firms in research-intensive industries are more likely to locate in states with high R\&D intensity. Foreign firms in the pharmaceutical industry value state R\&D intensity the most, at a level twice that of firms in the semiconductor industry, and four times that of electronics firms. Interestingly, not only firms from technically lagging nations, but also some firms from technically leading nations are attracted to R\&D intensive states. This suggests that beyond catching up, firms use knowledge-seeking investments also to source technical diversity.},

With respect to the empirical literature on entry games originated by Bresnahan and Reiss (1990) and Berry (1992), the main novelty of our framework is to allow for general forms of heterogeneity across players without making equilibrium selection assumptions. We allow the effects that the entry of each individual airline has on the profits of its competitors, its ``competitive effects,'' to differ across airlines. The identified features of the model are sets of parameters (partial identification) such that the choice probabilities predicted by the econometric model are consistent with the empirical choice probabilities estimated from the data. We apply this methodology to investigate the empirical importance of firm heterogeneity as a determinant of market structure in the U.S. airline industry. We find evidence of heterogeneity across airlines in their profit functions. The competitive effects of large airlines (American, Delta, United) are different from those of low cost carriers and Southwest. Also, the competitive effect of an airline is increasing in its airport presence, which is an important measure of observable heterogeneity in the airline industry. Then we develop a policy experiment to estimate the effect of repealing the Wright Amendment on competition in markets out of the Dallas airports. We find that repealing the Wright Amendment would increase the number of markets served out of Dallas Love.},

Long considered one of the rare bargains of the US healthcare system, the generic drug market experienced a series of unprecedented price spikes over the past decade, which have been linked to the collusive conduct of manufacturers in the so-called ``largest corporate cartel in US history.'' Using unsealed records of the ring's activity, I examine how collusion\textemdash in combination with other contemporaneous features of the market\textemdash affected upstream drug prices. I design a model of retail drug procurement, wherein generic manufacturers submit bids to supply national pharmacies with their drugs, and estimate this model using an estimator which accepts highly aggregated data of firms' winning bids. In doing so, I recover novel estimates of manufacturers' costs. Counterfactuals indicate that the collusive ring generated over \$12 billion in surplus for itself over 18 months and, moreover, that the unprecedented backlog of generic drug applications at the Food and Drug Administration in this period exacerbated the situation. I conclude by discussing the effects of recently proposed pro-competitive policies in view of my findings.},

Using patient claims data, we show that among skilled doctors, using a broader portfolio of drugs predicts better patient outcomes, except in cases where doctors' decisions violate loose professional guidelines. We introduce a behavioral model of decision making guided by our empirical observations. The model's novel feature is that the trade-off between exploitation and experimentation depends on the doctor's diagnostic skill. The model predicts that higher diagnostic skill leads to greater diversity in drug choice and better matching of drugs to patients even among doctors with the same initial beliefs regarding drug effectiveness. Consistent with the finding that guideline violations predict poorer patient outcomes, simulations of the model suggest that increasing the number of possible drug choices can lower performance.},

This approach does not require assumptions on the market structure or demand curves faced by firms, nor assumptions on how firms allocate their inputs across products. We exploit quantity and price information to disentangle markups from quantity-based productivity, and then compute marginal costs by dividing observed prices by the estimated markups. We use India's trade liberalization episode to examine how firms adjust these performance measures. Not surprisingly, we find that trade liberalization lowers factory-gate prices and that output tariff declines have the expected pro-competitive effects. However, the price declines are small relative to the declines in marginal costs, which fall predominantly because of the input tariff liberalization. The reason for this incomplete cost pass-through to prices is that firms offset their reductions in marginal costs by raising markups. Our results demonstrate substantial heterogeneity and variability in markups across firms and time and suggest that producers benefited relative to consumers, at least immediately after the reforms.},

We show that agency contracts can lead to higher or lower retail prices than wholesale contracts depending on the distribution of bargaining power. We propose a methodology to structurally estimate a model with either contract form under Nash-in-Nash bargaining. We apply our model to the e-book industry, which transitioned from wholesale to agency contracts after the expiration of a ban on agency contracting imposed in the antitrust settlement between U.S. Department of Justice and the major publishers. Using a unique dataset of e-book prices, we show that the transition to agency contracting increased Amazon prices substantially but had little effect on Barnes \& Noble prices. We find that the assumption of Nash-in-Nash bargaining explains the data better than an assumption of take-it or leave-it input contracts. Counterfactual simulations indicate that reinstitution of most favored nation clauses, which were banned for five years in the 2012 settlement, would raise the prices of non-fiction books by nearly nine percent.},

We use simple theory to illustrate this, and then combine detailed browsing data from eBay and an equilibrium model of consumer search and price competition to quantitatively assess this trade-off in the particular context of a change in eBay's marketplace design.},

Our game of incomplete information always has an equilibrium in cutoff entry/exit strategies. In contrast, the existence of an equilibrium in the Ericson and Pokes' model of industry dynamics requires admissibility of mixed entry/exit strategies, contrary to the assertion in their article, that existing algorithms cannot cope with. In addition, we provide a condition on the model's primitives that ensures that the equilibrium is in pure investment strategies. Building on this basic existence result, we first show that a symmetric equilibrium exists under appropriate assumptions on the model s primitives. Second, we show that, as the distribution of the random scrap values/setup costs becomes degenerate, equilibria in cutoff entry/exit strategies converge to equilibria in mixed entry/exit strategies of the game of complete information.]},

We discuss problems with typical implementations, including cases that can lead to incorrect parameter estimates. As a solution, we recast estimation as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints, which can be faster and which avoids the numerical issues associated with nested inner loops. The advantages are even more pronounced for forward-looking demand models where the Bellman equation must also be solved repeatedly. Several Monte Carlo and real-data experiments support our numerical concerns about the nested fixed point approach and the advantages of constrained optimization. For static BLP, the constrained optimization approach can be as much as ten to forty times faster for large-dimensional problems with many markets.},

This fact has led policymakers in the US to consider legislation for price controls. This paper assesses the effects of a hypothetical US reference pricing policy that would cap prices in US markets by those offered in Canada. We estimate a structural model of demand and supply for pharmaceuticals in the US and Canada, in which Canadian prices are set through a negotiation process between pharmaceutical companies and the Canadian government. We then simulate the impacts of the counterfactual international reference pricing rule, allowing firms to internalize the cross-country impacts of their prices both when setting prices in the US and when negotiating prices in Canada. We find that such a policy results in a slight decrease in US prices and a substantial increase in Canadian prices. The magnitude of these effects depends on the particular structure of the policy. Overall, we find modest consumer welfare gains in the US but substantial consumer welfare losses in Canada. Moreover, we find that pharmaceutical profits increase in net, suggesting that reference pricing of this form would constitute a net transfer from consumers to firms.},

We focus on long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) and the large (approximately \$13,500) jump in Medicare payments they receive when a patient's stay reaches a threshold number of days. Discharges increase substantially after the threshold, with the marginal discharged patient in relatively better health. Despite the large financial incentives and behavioral response in a high mortality population, we are unable to detect any compelling evidence of an impact on patient mortality. To assess provider behavior under counterfactual payment schedules, we estimate a simple dynamic discrete choice model of LTCH discharge decisions. When we conservatively limit ourselves to alternative contracts that hold the LTCH harmless, we find that an alternative contract can generate Medicare savings of about \$2,100 per admission, or about 5\% of total payments. More aggressive payment reforms can generate substantially greater savings, but the accompanying reduction in LTCH profits has potential out-of-sample consequences. Our results highlight how improved financial incentives may be able to reduce healthcare spending, without negative consequences for industry profits or patient health.},

An important insight from these models is that plausible single-crossing assumptions about preferences generate strong predictions about the equilibrium distribution of households across communities. To date, these predictions have not been subjected to formal empirical tests. The purpose of this paper is to provide an integrated approach for testing predictions from this class of models. We first test conditions for locational equilibrium implied by these models. In particular, we test predictions about the distribution of households by income across communities. We then test the models' predictions about the relationships among locational equilibrium conditions, housing markets, and housing prices. By drawing inferences from a structural general equilibrium model, the paper offers a unified treatment of theory and empirical testing.

Our findings show that this market contains too few products and that a reduction in competition decreases both the number and variety of products. These results suggest that product choice adjustment may exacerbate the welfare effect of a merger.},

What are the driving forces behind the changes in the gender labour-market outcomes over the period 1968\textendash 1997? It formulates a dynamic general equilibrium model of labour supply, occupational sorting, and human-capital accumulation in which gender discrimination and an earnings gap arise endogenously. It uses this model to quantify the driving forces behind the decline in the gender earnings gap and the increase in female labour-force participation, the proportion of women working in professional occupations, and hours worked. It finds that labour-market experience is the most important factor explaining the gender earnings gap. In addition, statistical discrimination accounts for a large fraction of the observed gender earnings gap and its decline. It also finds that a large increase in aggregate productivity in professional occupations plays a major role in the increase in female labour-force participation, number of hours worked, and the proportion of females working in professional occupations. Although of less importance, demographic changes account for a substantial part of the increase in female labour-force participation and hours worked, whereas home production technology shocks do not.},

The key idea is that products that provide a higher surplus should be ranked higher on the screen in response to consumer queries. We use a unique dataset of U.S. hotel reservations made over a three-month period through Travelocity, which we supplement with data from various social media sources using techniques from text mining, image classification, social geo-tagging, human annotations, and geo-mapping. We propose a random coefficient hybrid structural model, taking into consideration the two sources of consumer heterogeneity the different travel occasions and different hotel characteristics introduce. Based on the estimates from the model, we infer the economic impact of various location and service characteristics of hotels. We then propose a new hotel ranking system based on the average utility gain a consumer receives from staying in a particular hotel. By doing so, we can provide customers with the ``best-value" hotels early on. Our user studies, using ranking comparisons from several thousand users, validates the superiority of our ranking system relative to existing systems on several travel search engines.

High markups are explained to a large extent by informational asymmetries across consumers, where full information models predict markups of one-fourth the magnitude.

Using a panel data set extending from 1980 to 1993, the authors first demonstrate two main facts concerning car prices in Europe: (1) The existence of significant differences in quality adjusted prices across countries; (2) substantial year-to-year volatility that is to a large extent accounted for by exchange rate fluctuation and the incomplete response of local currency prices to these fluctuations. These facts are analyzed within the framework of a multi-product oligopoly model with product differentiation. The model identifies three potential sources for the international price differences: price elasticities generating differences in markups, costs, and import quota constraints. The authors find that the primary reason for the higher prices in Italy is the existence of a strong bias for domestic brands that generates high markups for the domestic firm. In the UK higher prices are mainly attributed to better equipped cars and/or differences in the dealer car practices. The import quota constraints are found to have a significant impact on Japanese car prices},

The estimated elasticity of expanded basic is about -15, with the demand for premium cable and DBS more elastic. The results identify strong correlations in the taste for different products not captured in conventional logit models. Estimates of the supply response of cable suggest that without DBS entry cable prices would be about 15 percent higher and cable quality would fall. We find a welfare gain of between \$127 and \$190 per year (aggregate \$2.5 billion) for satellite buyers, and about \$50 (aggregate \$3 billion) for cable subscribers.},

These effects are concentrated among hospitals previously paying relatively high prices for brands purchased in large volumes. Evidence from coronary stents suggests that transparency allows hospitals to resolve asymmetric information problems, but savings are limited in part by the stickiness of contracts in business-to-business settings. Savings are largest for physician preference items, where high-price, high-quantity hospital-brand combinations average 3.9\% savings, versus 1.6\% for commodities.},

First, we show that the benchmark model is nonindentified from observed bids. We also derive the restrictions imposed by the model on observables and show that these restrictions are weak. Second, we establish the nonparametric identification of the bidders' utility function under exclusion restrictions. Our primary exclusion restriction takes the form of an exogenous bidders' participation, leading to a latent distribution of private values that is independent of the number of bidders. The key idea is to exploit the property that the bid distribution varies with the number of bidders while the private value distribution does not. We then extend these results to endogenous bidders' participation when the exclusion restriction takes the form of instruments that do not affect the bidders' private value distribution. Though derived for a benchmark model, our results extend to more general cases such as a binding reserve price, affiliated private values, and asymmetric bidders. Last, possible estimation methods are proposed.},

Rather than relying on one stylized model to provide                     an exact interpretation of the data, we explore an incomplete model based on two                     simple assumptions: bidders neither bid more than their valuations nor let an                     opponent win at a price they would be willing to beat. Focusing on the symmetric                     independent private values paradigm, we show that this limited structure enables                     construction of informative bounds on the distribution function characterizing                     bidder demand, on the optimal reserve price, and on the effects of observable                     covariates on bidder valuations. If the standard theoretical model happens to be                     the true model, our bounds collapse to the true features of interest. In                     contrast, when the true data-generating process deviates in seemingly                     small ways from that implied by equilibrium in the standard theoretical model,                     existing methods can yield misleading results that need not even lie within our                     bounds.

Heterogeneity bias arises from comparing different goods in different locations, and variety bias arises from not correcting for the fact that some goods are unavailable in some locations. Eliminating heterogeneity bias causes 97\% of the variance in the price level of food products across cities to disappear relative to a conventional index. Eliminating both biases reverses the common finding that prices tend to be higher in larger cities. Instead, we find that price level for food products falls with city size.},

To examine these questions, we use a plant-level panel covering U.K. manufacturing from 1973 through 1992. Consistent with spillovers, we estimate a robust and significantly positive correlation between a domestic plant's TFP and the foreign-affiliate share of activity in that plant's industry. Typical estimates suggest that a 10-percentage-point increase in foreign presence in a U.K. industry raises the TFP of that industry's domestic plants by about 0.5\%. We also use these estimates to calculate the per-job value of these spillovers at about 2,400 in 2000 prices (\$4,300). These calculated values appear to be less than per-job incentives governments have granted in recent high-profile cases, in some cases several times less.},

We first estimate demand models which do not restrict unduly the pattern of consumer preferences as does much previous research in the area of differenciated products. Using recently available transactions data we estimate own and cross price elasticities in a relatively unrestricted manner. We next turn to competitive analysis using our estimated demand system. We consider two applications in this paper. The main economic factor that we consider is that the firms which produce the differentiated products almost always tend to be multi-product firms in the given industry. Our first application is competitive analysis when two firms are allowed to merge. The other application that we consider is inference on the competitive structure in an industry. In both applications we consider the effect of a multi-product firm where its competitive decisions for one brand affects it sales and prices for other brands that it produces. /// La diff\'erenciation des produits est un aspect \'economique central de la concurrence sur les march\'es des biens de consommations comme les c\'er\'eales, les sodas ou les bi\`eres.

The paper takes a revealed preference approach, inferring the magnitude of density economies from how much sales cannibalization of closely packed stores Wal-Mart is willing to suffer to achieve density economies. The model is dynamic with rich geographic detail on the locations of stores and distribution centers. Given the enormous number of possible combinations of store-opening sequences, it is difficult to directly solve Wal-Mart's problem, making conventional approaches infeasible. The moment inequality approach is used instead and works well. The estimates show the benefits to Wal-Mart of high store density are substantial and likely extend significantly beyond savings in trucking costs.},

However, heterogeneity in firms' strategic ability also generates inefficiencies. We study the Texas electricity market where firms exhibit significant heterogeneity in how they deviate from Nash equilibrium bidding. These deviations, in turn, increase the cost of production. To explain this heterogeneity, we embed a cognitive hierarchy model into a structural model of bidding and estimate firms' strategic sophistication. We find that firm size and manager education affect sophistication. Using the model, we show that mergers which increase sophistication can increase efficiency despite increasing market concentration. (JEL D24, D43, G34, L13, L25, L94)},

Our main identifying assumption is that, conditional on the value of the true regressors, some ``measure of location'' of the distribution of the measurement error (e.g., its mean, mode, or median) is equal to zero. The proposed approach relies on the eigenvalue\textendash eigenfunction decomposition of an integral operator associated with specific joint probability densities. The main identifying assumption is used to ``index'' the eigenfunctions so that the decomposition is unique.

  abstract = {This chapter reviews recent advances in nonparametric and semiparametric estimation, with an emphasis on applicability to empirical research and on resolving issues that arise in implementation. It considers techniques for estimating densities, conditional mean functions, derivatives of functions and conditional quantiles in a flexible way that imposes minimal functional form assumptions. The chapter begins by illustrating how flexible modeling methods have been applied in empirical research, drawing on recent examples of applications from labor economics, consumer demand estimation and treatment effects models. Then, key concepts in semiparametric and nonparametric modeling are introduced that do not have counterparts in parametric modeling, such as the so-called curse of dimensionality, the notion of models with an infinite number of parameters, the criteria used to define optimal convergence rates, and ``dimension-free'' estimators. After defining these new concepts, a large literature on nonparametric estimation is reviewed and a unifying framework presented for thinking about how different approaches relate to one another. Local polynomial estimators are discussed in detail and their distribution theory is developed. The chapter then shows how nonparametric estimators form the building blocks for many semiparametric estimators, such as estimators for average derivatives, index models, partially linear models, and additively separable models. Semiparametric methods offer a middle ground between fully nonparametric and parametric approaches. Their main advantage is that they typically achieve faster rates of convergence than fully nonparametric approaches. In many cases, they converge at the parametric rate. The second part of the chapter considers in detail two issues that are central with regard to implementing flexible modeling methods: how to select the values of smoothing parameters in an optimal way and how to implement ``trimming'' procedures. It also reviews newly developed techniques for deriving the distribution theory of semiparametric estimators. The chapter concludes with an overview of approximation methods that speed up the computation of nonparametric estimates and make flexible estimation feasible even in very large size samples.},

First, we define a new equilibrium concept that we call moment-based Markov equilibrium (MME), in which firms keep track of their own state, the detailed state of dominant firms, and few moments of the distribution of fringe firms' states. Second, we provide guidelines to use MME in applied work and illustrate with an application how it can endogenize the market structure in a dynamic industry model even with hundreds of firms. Third, we develop a series of results that provide support for using MME as an approximation. We present numerical experiments showing that MME approximates MPE for important classes of models. Then, we introduce novel unilateral deviation error bounds that can be used to test the accuracy of MME as an approximation in large-scale settings. Overall, our new framework opens the door to study new issues in industry dynamics.},

To empirically assess these three forces, I estimate a dynamic oligopoly model using a unique panel data set of hard disk drive manufacturers. The results suggest that despite strong preemptive motives and a substantial cost advantage over entrants, cannibalization makes incumbents reluctant to innovate, which can explain at least 57 percent of the incumbent-entrant innovation gap.},

Based on the estimates, we compare several alternative market power tests: a hypothetical market power test, an actual market power test and a comparative market power test. Our comparison of these alternative tests illustrates that the recently introduced empirical techniques need not be in conflict with traditional policy practices in Europe, but should be seen as a natural extension of commonly accepted principles. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of our dynamic comparative market power test in the European context. According to this test, the relevant point of comparison when assessing a merger is not the status quo, but rather a relevant alternative merger scenario that is likely to happen in the event the merger is rejected. In a European context, the choice is often to accept a sequence of regionally based mergers or rather a sequence of pan-European mergers. Finally, we also emphasize the importance of constructing confidence intervals when computing the predicted merger effects, especially if one is interested in testing the hypothesis that a merger has no effects.}

We acquire a detailed proprietary dataset from the insurer and match it with competitor price menus. We first quantify the degree to which monitoring incentivizes safer driving and allows more accurate risk-based pricing. We then model the demand and supply forces that determine the amount of information revealed in equilibrium: structural demand estimates capture correlations among cost and demand for insurance and for monitoring; a dynamic pricing model links the firm's information on driver risk to prices. We find large profit and welfare gains from introducing monitoring. Safer drivers self-select into monitoring, with those who opt in becoming 30\% safer when monitored. Given resource costs and price competition, a data-sharing mandate would have reduced short-term welfare.},

The estimation strategy is computationally simple as it does not require solving for the equilibrium of the game. It uses a two stage approach. In the first stage the distribution of bids conditional on state variables is estimated using data on bids, bidder characteristics, and contract characteristics. In the second stage, an expression of the expected sum of future profits based on the distribution of bids is obtained, and costs are inferred based on the first order condition of optimal bids. We apply the estimation method to repeated highway construction procurement auctions in the state of California between May 1996 and May 1999. In this market, previously won uncompleted contracts reduce the probability of winning further contracts. We quantify the effect of intertemporal constraints on bidders' costs and on bids. Due to the intertemporal effect and also to bidder asymmetry, the auction can be inefficient. Based on the estimates of costs, we quantify efficiency losses.},

We estimate the model via simulated minimum distance, matching both production and financial data. We find that financial factors and nonpecuniary benefits are of first-order importance. Collateral constraints and liquidity restrictions inhibit borrowing and the accumulation of capital, especially among high-productivity firms seeking to expand. The nonpecuniary benefits to farming are large and keep small, low-productivity farms in business. Although farmers are risk averse, eliminating uninsured production risk has only modest effects on capital and output. (JEL C51, D24, G32, Q12, Q14)},

The objective of econometric modeling is to determine the nature of substitution among inputs, the character of differences in technology, and the role of economies of scale. The principal contribution of recent advances in methodology has been to exploit the potential of economic theory in achieving this objective. Important innovations in specifying econometric models have arisen from the dual formulation of the theory of production. The chief advantage of this formulation is in generating demands and supplies as the explicit functions of relative prices. By using duality in production theory, these functions can be specified without imposing arbitrary restrictions on the patterns of production. The econometric modeling of producer behavior requires parametric forms for demand and supply functions. The patterns of production can be represented in terms of unknown parameters that specify the responses of demands and supplies to changes in prices, technology, and scale. New measures of substitution, technical change, and economies of scale have provided greater flexibility in the empirical determination of production patterns.},

Building on earlier work by Berry and Haile (2013), we show that key identifying restrictions are provided by (i) a set of moment conditions generated by instrumental variables together with an inversion of aggregate demand in unobserved product characteristics; and (ii) the variation of the product characteristics across markets that is exogenous to the individual heterogeneity. We further show that two leading models, the BLP-model (Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes, 1995) and the pure characteristics model (Berry and Pakes, 2007), require considerably different conditions on the support of the product characteristics.},

A portfolio choice model implies characteristics-based demand when returns have a factor structure and expected returns and factor loadings depend on the assets' own characteristics. We propose an instrumental variables estimator for the characteristics-based demand system to address the endogeneity of demand and asset prices. Using US stock market data, we illustrate how the model could be used to understand the role of institutions in asset market movements, volatility, and predictability.},

A constraint preserves the substitutes condition if and only if it is a ``generalized interval constraint,'' which specifies the minimum and maximum numbers of hired doctors, forces some hires, and forbids others. Additionally, ``generalized polyhedral constraints'' are precisely those that preserve the substitutes condition for all ``group separable'' revenue functions. (JEL C78, D47, I11, J23, J41, J44)},

Counterfactual simulations reveal that bidders' uncertainty about the number of entrants, combined with risk aversion, substantially softens the revenue impact of low competition in first-price auctions. This explains the observed revenue patterns and uncovers an empirically important reason for sellers to favor first-price auctions over English auctions.},

Spring infrastructure investments reduce fecal contamination by 66\%, but household water quality improves less, due to recontamination. Child diarrhea falls by one quarter. Travel-cost based revealed preference estimates of households' valuations are much smaller than both stated preference valuations and health planners' valuations, and are consistent with models in which the demand for health is highly income elastic. We estimate that private property norms would generate little additional investment while imposing large static costs due to above-marginal-cost pricing, private property would function better at higher income levels or under water scarcity, and alternative institutions could yield Pareto improvements.},

Following McFadden (1989) and Pakes and Pollard (1989), our proposed method is based on simulations. Specifically, the method relies on a simulated nonlinear least squares objective function appropriately adjusted so as to obtain consistent estimates of the parameters of interest. We illustrate the proposed method by studying a market of agricultural products, where descending auctions are used. Our analysis takes into account heterogeneity of the auctioned objects and the fact that only the winning bid is observed. We estimate the parameters that characterize the distribution of the unobserved private values for each auctioned object.]},

We show that a hotel's demand is positively correlated with their average rating across TripAdvisor, Expedia and Hotels.com. Such correlations have grown over our sample period from a statistical zero in 2005 to a substantial level in 2014: a hotel rated one star higher on all the platforms on average has 27.8\% higher demand. By contrast, an increase in average ratings has a negligible e ect on hotels' pricing schedules (i.e. supply). A natural experiment in our data that caused abrupt changes in the ratings of some hotels but not others suggests that these associations are causal.

Speci"cally, we model each bidder's private information as the product of two unobserved independent components, one speci"c to the auctioned object and common to all bidders, the other speci"c to each bidder. The structural elements of the model include the distributions of the common component and the idiosyncratic component. Noting that the above decomposition is related to a measurement error problem with multiple indicators, we show that both distributions are identi"ed from observed bids in the CIPV case. On the other hand, identi"cation of the pure CV model is achieved under additional restrictions. We then propose a computationally simple two-step nonparametric estimation procedure using kernel estimators in the "rst step and empirical characteristic functions in the second step. The consistency of the two density estimators is established. An application to the OCS wildcat auctions shows that the distribution of the common component is much more concentrated than the distribution of the idiosyncratic component. This suggests that idiosyncratic components are more likely to explain the variability of private information and hence of bids than the common component. 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

A central idea is to formulate off-path beliefs conditional on counterfactual pairwise deviations and on-path beliefs in the absence of such deviations. A matching-belief configuration is stable if the matching is individually rational with respect to the system of on-path beliefs and is not blocked with respect to the system of off-path beliefs. The formulation provides a language for assessing matching outcomes with respect to their supporting beliefs and opens the door to further belief-based refinements. The main refinement analyzed in the paper requires the Bayesian consistency of on-path and off-path beliefs with prior beliefs. We define concepts of Bayesian efficiency, the rational expectations competitive equilibrium, and the core. Their contrast with pairwise stability manifests the role of information asymmetry in matching formation. (JEL C78, D40, D82, D83)},

  abstract = {This paper studies whether removing barriers to trade induces efficiency gains for producers. Like almost all empirical work which relies on a production function to re-cover productivity measures, I do not observe physical output at the firm level. There-fore, it is imperative to control for unobserved prices and demand shocks. I develop an empirical model that combines a demand system with a production function to gener-ate estimates of productivity. I rely on my framework to identify the productivity effects from reduced trade protection in the Belgian textile market. This trade liberalization provides me with observed demand shifters that are used to separate out the associated price, scale, and productivity effects. Using a matched plant\textendash product level data set and detailed quota data, I find that correcting for unobserved prices leads to substantially lower productivity gains. More specifically, abolishing all quota protections increases firm-level productivity by only 2 percent as opposed to 8 percent when relying on stan-dard measures of productivity. My results beg for a serious reevaluation of a long list of empirical studies that document productivity responses to major industry shocks and, in particular, to opening up to trade. My findings imply the need to study the impact of changes in the operating environment on productivity together with market power and prices in one integrated framework. The suggested method and identification strategy are quite general and can be applied whenever it is important to distinguish between revenue productivity and physical productivity.},

To do so, we exploit recent variation in vertical structure in the US carbonated-beverage industry. While the elimination of double marginalization with vertical integration is normally characterized as procompetitive, economic theory predicts that it may cause anticompetitive price increases in multiproduct industries. We indeed find that vertical integration causes price decreases in products with eliminated double margins but price increases in the other products sold by the integrated firm. These results provide new evidence of anticompetitive effects of vertical mergers. (JEL D22, D43, G34, L13, L22, L66)},

One has some prior information about the population and a random sample of observations. A widely applicable approach is to estimate the parameter by a sample analog; that is, by a statistic having the same properties in the sample as the parameter does in the population. If there is no such statistic, then one may choose an estimate that, in some well-defined sense, makes the known properties of the population hold as closely as possible in the sample. These are analog estimation methods. This chapter surveys some uses of analog methods to estimate two classes of econometric models, the separable and the response models.},

The addition of this language to the Clayton Act in 1950 by the Celler-Kefauver Act led U.S. antitrust courts and antitrust-enforcement agencies to analyze the legality of all business conduct covered by the Clayton Act by defining relevant product and geographic markets (``lines of commerce'' and ``sections of the country'') and deriving competitive-impact predictions from relevant-market-aggregated data\textemdash inter alia, data on firm market shares, traditional seller-side concentration ratios, and (more recently) HHI figures.

  abstract = {Both U.S. antitrust law and E.C./E.U. competition law prohibit ``monopolizing'' or ``attempting to monopolize'' either explicitly in those terms or by using other words to proscribe such conduct. Thus, Section 2 of the U.S. Sherman Act explicitly prohibits firms from monopolizing or attempting to monopolize; in essence, Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits firms from monopolizing by entering into contracts, agreements, or conspiracies in restraint of trade; and Article 102 of the 2009 Lisbon Treaty prohibits firms that are individually dominant or members of a set of rivals that are collectively dominant from committing exclusionary abuses of their dominant position. Unfortunately, none of these statutes or treaties and none of the economic and legal scholars and judges that have analyzed the character of particular business behavior has ever explicitly defined ``monopolizing conduct'' or ``exclusionary abuse,'' and the implicit definitions of these concepts that can be derived from the operational decision-rules that scholars recommend be used to decide and that judges have used to decide whether to hold defendants guilty of monopolizing contain both errors of commission and errors of omission. Chapter 3 defines the concepts ``monopolizing conduct'' and ``attempts to monopolize'' and comments on what I take to be the coincident concept of an exclusionary abuse (of a dominant position). Inter alia, Chap. 4 explains the errors that relevant judges and antitrust-enforcement agencies have made when operationalizing these concepts.},

In a Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE), a firm's move in any period depends only on the other firm's current price. There are multiple MPE's, consisting of both kinked demand curve equilibria and Edgeworth cycles. In any MPE, profit is bounded away from the Bertrand equilibrium level. We show that a kinked demand curve at the monopoly price is the unique symmetric "renegotiation proof" equilibrium when there is little discounting. We then endogenize the timing by allowing firms to move at any time subject to we short-run commitments. We find that firms end up alternating, thus vindicating the ad hoc timing assumption of our simpler model. We also discuss how the model can be enriched to provide explanations for excess capacity and market sharing.]},

The chapter shows, first, how economic restrictions can guarantee the identification of nonparametric functions in several structural models. It then describes how shape restrictions can be used to estimate nonparametric functions using popular methods for nonparametric estimation. Finally, the chapter describes how to test nonparametrically the hypothesis that an economic model is correct and the hypothesis that a nonparametric function satisfies some specified shape properties.},

This chapter presents some of the recent results on the identification of nonparametric econometric models. It considers identification in models that are additive in unobservable random terms and in models that are nonadditive in unobservable random terms. Single equation models as well as models with a system of equations are studied. Among the latter, special attention is given to structural models whose reduced forms are triangular in the unobservable random terms, and to simultaneous equations, where the reduced forms are functions of all the unobservable variables in the system. The chapter first presents some general identification results for single-equation models that are additive in unobservable random terms, single-equation models that are nonadditive in unobservable random terms, single-equation models that possess and index structure, simultaneous equations nonadditive in unobservable random terms, and discrete choice models. Then, particular ways of achieving identification are considered. These include making use of conditional independence restrictions, marginal independence restrictions, shape restrictions on functions, shape restrictions on distributions, and restrictions in both functions and distributions. The objective is to provide insight into some of the recent techniques that have been developed recently, rather than on presenting a complete survey of the literature.},

This paper reviews the theory of WTP measurement, and provides easily computed WTP bounds. It reviews generalized extreme value (GEV) random utility models, where analytic formulas for WTP result when indirect utility is linear in income. It shows that a representative consumer characterization of the random utility model, which yields exact WTP when indirect utility is linear in income, can give substantially biased estimates of WTP when indirect utility is nonlinear in income. Finally, it describes a monte carlo markov chain simulation method that can be used to obtain accurate approximation of mean WTP in GEV random utility models that are nonlinear in income. This procedure is of independent interest as a method for obtaining random draws from a GEV density.},

Practical estimation of a parametric mixing family can be carried out by Maximum Simulated Likelihood Estimation or Method of Simulated Moments, and easily computed instruments are provided that make the latter procedure fairly efficient. The adequacy of a mixing specification can be tested simply as an omitted variable test with appropriately defined artificial variables.

A two stage model is developed in which bidders may acquire information at a cost before bidding and for which the equilibrium price is fully revealing, resolving a well-known paradox.]},

We find that under the state's current tax policy, spirits are overpriced. Distillers respond to decreases in the tax rate by increasing wholesale prices, which limits the state's revenue gain to only 13\% of the incremental tax revenue predicted under the common assumption of perfect competition.

These indirect network effects arise due to inter-dependence in demand for hardware and compatible software. By modeling the joint determination of hardware sales and software availability in the market, we are able to describe the nature of demand inter-dependence and to measure the size of the indirect network effects. We apply the model to price and sales data from the industry for personal digital assistants (PDAs) along with the availability of software titles compatible with each PDA hardware standard. Our empirical results indicate significant indirect network effects. By July 2002, the network effect explains roughly 22\% of the log-odds ratio of the sales of all Palm O/S compatible PDA-s to Microsoft O/S compatible PDA-s, where the remaining 78\% reflects price and model features. We also use our model estimates to study the growth of the installed bases of Palm and Microsoft PDA hardware, with and without the availability of compatible third party software. We find that lack of third party software negatively impacts the evolution of the installed hardware bases of both formats. These results suggest PDA hardware firms would benefit from investing resources in increasing the provision of software for their products. We then compare the benefits of investments in software with investments in the quality of hardware technology. This exercise helps disentangle the potential for incremental hardware sales due to hardware quality improvement from that of positive feedback due to market software provision.},

The null hypotheses of these homogeneity tests are necessary conditions (or maintained assumptions) for poolability of the data. Thus rejections of these null imply that the data cannot be pooled across markets. Acceptances of these null are considered as supporting evidences for the maintained assumptions of estimation using pooled data. In a Monte Carlo study we find that the test based on the steady-state distribution performs well and has high power even with small numbers of markets and time periods.

I find that standard simulation methods, which measure the effect of the change in ownership on unilateral pricing incentives, do not generally provide an accurate forecast. By incorporating postmerger information into the model, I measure the relative importance of other factors that also contributed to the observed price changes. The results indicate that the unexplained component of the price change is largely accounted for by supply-side effects. I conclude that deviations from the assumed model of firm conduct play an important role in accounting for the differences between the predicted and observed price changes. This conclusion suggests that the predictive performance of merger simulation would benefit if more flexible models of firm conduct were incorporated into the methodology.},

Using the two-step estimator of Bajari, Benkard, and Levin (2007), I recover the entire cost structure of the industry, including the distributions of sunk entry costs and capacity adjustment costs. My primary finding is that the Amendments have significantly increased the sunk cost of entry, leading to a loss of between \$ 810M and \$ 3.2B in product market surplus. A static analysis misses the welfare penalty on consumers, and obtains the wrong sign of the welfare effects on incumbent firms.]},

We allow the number of heterogeneous groups and the number of controls to exceed the sample size. To make informative inference possible, we assume that the treatment effect has a sparse representation and estimate it in two stages. In the first stage, we estimate the reduced form for treatment and outcome on an auxiliary sample. In the second stage, we estimate the treatment effect by 1-regularized least squares regression of outcome residuals on the treatment residuals. The proposed estimator presents an improved convergence rate over a one-stage alternative where the treatment effect and the control function are estimated jointly. In addition, we provide inference methods for single and multiple coefficients of the heterogeneous effects. We use a correlated random effects approach to model unobserved unit heterogeneity by extending the approaches from Mundlak (1978) and Cham-berlain (1982) to a high-dimensional setting. Using the data from a major food distributor, we apply our method to estimate price elasticities for a large number of heterogeneous products and validate our estimates using experimental price variation.},

In the first stage, I estimate the state variable's law of motion and the equilibrium policy function using machine learning tools. In the second stage, I plug the first-stage estimates into a moment inequality and solve for the structural parameter. The moment function is presented as the sum of two components, where the first one expresses the equilibrium assumption and the second one is a bias correction term that makes the sum insensitive (i.e., Neyman-orthogonal) to first-stage bias. The proposed estimator uniformly converges at the root-N rate and I use it to construct confidence regions. The results developed here can be used to incorporate high-dimensional state space into classic dynamic discrete choice models, for example, those considered in Rust (1987), Bajari et al.

It does so by estimating and solving, using parametric approximations to firms' value functions, a dynamic model that captures important features of the industry such as vertical and horizontal product differentiation, demographic variation in programming tastes, and multi-station ownership. The estimated model predicts that high fees would cause the number of music stations to fall significantly and quite quickly. For example, a fee equal to 10\% of revenues would cause a 4.6\% drop in the number of music stations within 2 1/2 years, and a 9.4\% drop in the long run. The size of the change is limited, however, by the fact that many listeners, particularly in demographics that are valued by advertisers, have strong preferences for music programming.},

  abstract = {Many studies have documented large and persistent productivity differences across producers, even within narrowly defined industries. This paper both extends and departs from the past literature, which focused on technological explanations for these differences, by proposing that demand-side features also play a role in creating the observed productivity variation. The specific mechanism investigated here is the effect of spatial substitutability in the product market. When producers are densely clustered in a market, it is easier for consumers to switch between suppliers (making the market in a certain sense more competitive). Relatively inefficient producers find it more difficult to operate profitably as a result. Increases in substitutability truncate the productivity distribution from below, resulting in higher minimum and average productivity levels as well as less productivity dispersion. The paper presents a model that makes this process explicit and empirically tests it using data from U.S. ready-mixed concrete plants, taking advantage of geographic variation in substitutability created by the industry's high transport costs. The results support the model's predictions and appear robust. Markets with high demand density for ready-mixed concrete\textemdash and thus high concrete plant densities\textemdash have higher lower-bound and average productivity levels and exhibit less productivity dispersion among their producers.},

In fact, marketing-mix variables, such as price, not only affect brand purchasing probabilities but are themselves endogenously set by marketing managers. This work tests whether these endogeneity problems are important enough to warrant consideration when estimating random utility models with scanner panel data.

Although this study constitutes the first attempt to use this direct optimization approach to address a specific empirical problem, the method can be used in a wide range of structural estimation problems. The empirical results support the agglomeration and clustering theories that predict that firms may have incentives to colocate despite potential business stealing effects. The author shows that the firms' negative and positive strategic effects help predict both how many firms can operate profitably in a given market and the firm-type configurations. The relative magnitude of such effects varies substantially across store types.},

The use of these models, as off-the-shelf instruments to assess the economic effects of mergers, has become increasingly widespread in recent years. However, contrary to some claims, merger simulation models do not allow investigators to avoid much of the competitive effects analysis relating to the relevant economic market, nor do they necessarily provide more precision to merger control. Without understanding the limitations of such models and the circumstances under which they can and should be usefully applied, they may not just be useless, but dangerous in the sense of providing possibly spurious results with spurious claimed accuracy. This paper argues that any merger simulation models used should be ``bespoke'' models, rather than off-the-shelf models, but cautions that even bespoke models will frequently not be as useful as is often claimed. This is not to deny that there are occasions when well-constructed bespoke models are genuinely useful and do offer genuine improvements in merger control.},

We also extend the definition of oblivious equilibrium, originally proposed for models with only firm-specific idiosyncratic random shocks, and our algorithms to accommodate models with industry-wide aggregate shocks. Our results suggest that, by using oblivious equilibrium to approximate Markov-perfect equilibrium, it is possible to greatly increase the set of dynamic models of imperfect competition that can be analyzed computationally.

Moreover, we show that, as the market becomes large, if the equilibrium distribution of firm states obeys a certain ``light-tail'' condition, then oblivious equilibria closely approximate Markov perfect equilibria.

This paper estimates a structural model of the US commercial vehicle market and demonstrates the importance of allowing for endogenous product offerings in the context of the \$85 billion automotive industry bailout in 2009. Under alternate policies that facilitate an acquisition or liquidation of GM and Chrysler, product entry and exit moderate markup increases and output decreases by up to three-quarters.},

I formulate a dynamic structural model of a dominant upstream firm and oligopolistic downstream firms that invest in complementary innovations. I estimate the model using data on the System-on-Chip (SoC) and smartphone industries. The results suggest that a vertical merger can increase innovation and welfare, mainly driven by the investment coordination of the merged firms. I also find that subsidizing the upstream innovation increases overall private investment, innovation, and welfare.},

  abstract = {Sponsored search advertising is ascendant\textemdash Forrester Research reports expenditures rose 28\% in 2007 to \$8.1 billion and will continue to rise at a 26\% compound annual growth rate [VanBoskirk, S. 2007. U.S. interactive marketing forecast, 2007 to 2012. Forrester Research (October 10)], approaching half the level of television advertising and making sponsored search one of the major advertising trends to affect the marketing landscape. Yet little empirical research exists to explore how the interaction of various agents (searchers, advertisers, and the search engine) in keyword markets affects consumer welfare and firm profits. The dynamic structural model we propose serves as a foundation to explore these outcomes. We fit this model to a proprietary data set provided by an anonymous search engine. These data include consumer search and clicking behavior, advertiser bidding behavior, and search engine information such as keyword pricing and website design. With respect to advertisers, we find evidence of dynamic bidding behavior. Advertiser value for clicks on their links averages about 26 cents. Given the typical \$22 retail price of the software products advertised on the considered search engine, this implies a conversion rate (sales per click) of about 1.2\%, well within common estimates of 1\%\textendash 2\% [Narcisse, E. 2007. Magid: Casual free to pay conversion rate too low. GameDaily.com (September 20)]. With respect to consumers, we find that frequent clickers place a greater emphasis on the position of the sponsored advertising link. We further find that about 10\% of consumers do 90\% of the clicks. We then conduct several policy simulations to illustrate the effects of changes in search engine policy. First, we find the search engine obtains revenue gains of 1\% by sharing individual-level information with advertisers and enabling them to vary their bids by consumer segment. This also improves advertiser revenue by 6\% and consumer welfare by 1.6\%. Second, we find that a switch from a first- to second-price auction results in truth telling (advertiser bids rise to advertiser valuations). However, the second-price auction has little impact on search engine profits. Third, consumer search tools lead to a platform revenue increase of 2.9\% and an increase of consumer welfare by 3.8\%. However, these tools, by reducing advertising exposures, lower advertiser profits by 2.1\%.},

  abstract = {In many markets, consumers visit stores and physically inspect products before making purchase decisions. We view the inspection of a product at a retail location as a search for product fit. We quantify the cost and benefit from searching for product fit using a discrete choice model of demand with optimal sequential search. In these models, the benefit of searching is measured by the standard deviation of the product fit and has, heretofore, been fixed to one in estimation. We show that, with an exogenous search cost shifter, both the cost and benefit of searching can be separately estimated. Our empirical setting is the U.S. automotive market. We assemble a unique data set containing individual-level smartphone geolocation data that inform us about dealership visits. We also obtain information on new vehicle purchases from proprietary DMV registration data. Our exogenous cost shifter is the distance a consumer must travel to visit a dealership. Our results show that the benefit provided by dealerships to consumers is substantial. Within our empirical context, failure to estimate the standard deviation of the product fit leads to biased search cost and consumer surplus estimates and to inaccurate predictions regarding consumers' number of searches and effects of at-home test drive programs.},
