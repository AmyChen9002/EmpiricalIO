abstract = {We document the numerical challenges we experienced estimating random-coefficient demand models as in Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995) using two well-known data sets and a thorough optimization design. The optimization algorithms often converge at points where the first- and second-order optimality conditions fail. There are also cases of convergence at local optima. On convergence, the variation in the values of the parameter estimates translates into variation in the models' economic predictions. Price elasticities and changes in consumer and producer welfare following hypothetical merger exercises vary at least by a factor of 2 and up to a factor of 5.},

abstract = {We consider identi{\ldots}cation of nonparametric random utility models of multinomial choice using "micro data,"i.e., observation of the characteristics and choices of individual consumers. Our model of preferences nests random coeÂ¢ cients discrete choice models widely used in practice with parametric functional form and distributional assumptions. However, the model is nonparametric and distribution free. It allows choice-speci{\ldots}c unobservables, endogenous choice characteristics, unknown heteroskedasticity, and high-dimensional correlated taste shocks. Under standard "large support"and instrumental variables assumptions, we show identi{\ldots}ability of the random utility model. We demonstrate robustness of these results to relaxation of the large support condition and show that when it is replaced with a weaker "common choice probability" condition , the demand structure is still identi{\ldots}ed. We show that key maintained hypotheses are testable. We have had helpful conversations on this topic with Liran Einav, Jin Hahn, Hide Ichimura, Jon Levin, Rosa Matzkin and Yuichi Kitamura. We also received useful comments from Sunyoung Park and participants in several conferences and seminars. Financial support from the NSF is gratefully acknowledged.},

@article{Berry2016,
abstract = {Empirical models of differentiated products demand (and often supply) are widely used in industrial organization and other fields of economics. We review some recent work studying identification in a broad class of such models. This work shows that the parametric functional forms and distributional assumptions commonly used for estimation are not essential for identification. Rather, identification relies primarily on the standard requirement that instruments be available for the endogenous variables-here, typically, prices and quantities. We discuss the types of instruments that can suffice, as well as how instrumental variables requirements can be relaxed by the availability of individual-level data or through restrictions on preferences. We also review new results on discrimination between alternative models of oligopoly competition. Together, these results reveal a strong nonparametric foundation for a broad applied literature, provide practical guidance for applied work, and may suggest new approaches to estimation and testing.},

@article{Dube2012,
abstract = {The widely used estimator of Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995) produces estimates of consumer preferences from a discrete-choice demand model with random coefficients, market-level demand shocks, and endogenous prices. We derive numerical theory results characterizing the properties of the nested fixed point algorithm used to evaluate the objective function of BLP's estimator. We discuss problems with typical implementations, including cases that can lead to incorrect parameter estimates. As a solution, we recast estimation as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints, which can be faster and which avoids the numerical issues associated with nested inner loops. The advantages are even more pronounced for forward-looking demand models where the Bellman equation must also be solved repeatedly. Several Monte Carlo and real-data experiments support our numerical concerns about the nested fixed point approach and the advantages of constrained optimization. For static BLP, the constrained optimization approach can be as much as ten to forty times faster for large-dimensional problems with many markets.},

I show that the semiparametric, multinomial maximum-score estimator is consistent when using data on a subset of choices. No information is required for choices outside of the subset. The required conditions about the error terms are the same conditions as for using all the choices. Estimation can proceed under additional restrictions if agents have unobserved, random consideration sets. A solution exists for instrumenting endogenous continuous variables. Monte Carlo experiments show the estimator performs well using small subsets of choices.},
